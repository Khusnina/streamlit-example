Title,Description
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Chapter I
You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn’t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, “Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon she would say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don’t you try to behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed a spider. I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.

Chapter II
We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson’s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:
“Who dah?”
He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch. Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:
“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n. Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.”
So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn’t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn’t want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome. As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches. Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:
“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.”
Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:
“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ’bout him?”
“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.
“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen in these parts for a year or more.”
They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn’t be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson—they could kill her. Everybody said:
“Oh, she’ll do. That’s all right. Huck can come in.”
Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.
“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”
“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.
“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”
“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,” says Tom Sawyer. ""We ain’t burglars. That ain’t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”
“Must we always kill the people?”
“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”
“Ransomed? What’s that?”
“I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve seen it in books; and so of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”
“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”
“Why, blame it all, we’ve got to do it. Don’t I tell you it’s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books, and get things all muddled up?”
“Oh, that’s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to them?—that’s the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it is?”
“Well, I don’t know. But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they’re dead.”
“Now, that’s something like. That’ll answer. Why couldn’t you said that before? We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they’ll be, too—eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.”
“How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there’s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”
“A guard! Well, that is good. So somebody’s got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that’s foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?”
“Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t you?—that’s the idea. Don’t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn ’em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”
“All right. I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?”
“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.”
“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it. Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”
Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t want to be a robber any more. So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people. Ben Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home. I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired."
A Ghost of A Chance,"Chapter 1
They say there are blessings from Katrina. Mine was I lost my job. I gaze around at the lush breakfast area of The Monteleone Hotel in New Orleans, enjoying eggs Benedict, crisp bacon and the creamiest grits I’ve had in years and force myself not to laugh. Life is looking up, despite my lack of job security. All I have to do is get on a plane, make my assignment and my life will resemble this from now on. “More coffee, ma’am?” I glance up from my newspaper I wasn’t really reading and there’s a red-headed man wearing a uniform more typical of the 1920s standing beside my table. And he isn’t carrying a coffee pot. Startled, I shake my head. I’ve had my caffeine quota for the day, promising my doctor I would stop at two cups in the morning. Of course, I never promised anything about afternoons. After all, I am a journalist. “Very good ma’am.” He bows and quietly saunters out the cafe door. I’d say float but that’s absurd. “Who was that?” I ask the waitress when she arrives to refill my cup. Despite my promises, I let her. “Who was what, dawlin?” After months in Cajun Country, it feels great to hear a New Orleans accent again, people we label “Yats” because they usually begin a greeting with “Where y’at?” It’s more Brooklyn than Southern, slower and more friendly. Definitely not the Hollywood, Tennessee Williams drawl most people assume to find here sprouting from residents dressed in seersucker and white bucks. The Yat sends me a puzzled grin with a hand on her hip, the kind siblings bestow on one another. This is New Orleans. We’re all related so why not just act like family. “Are you all doing a costume brunch now?” I ask, adding, “I’m writing a story on the hotel.” Dolores — it was written on her name tag right above “Ask About Our Rebirth Specials” — isn’t impressed with my assignment. She grabs one of her purple and gold hoop earrings and pulls, her snide expression unfaltering. “Did Margaret put you up to this?” “Who’s Margaret?” Dolores huffs and walks away, leaving me to ponder what the hell that was all about. I check my watch. Two hours. I’m meeting Mary Jo, my old roommate from college who is now the PR director of The Monteleone, and then I’m on my way. She’s late, as always, but this will be one of those times I’m not going to hang around, even though she set up my complimentary night at the historic hotel in the hopes I would write a glowing story to help attract tourists back to New Orleans; it’s been months since Katrina and many people still think we’re under water. But today my first press trip as a travel writer awaits and I have a plane to catch. Finally, Mary Jo appears, wearing her usual navy blue A-skirt and matching button-up sweater, topped by a discreet strand of pearls and cream-colored headband. I almost laugh because she could have walked out of the LSU Delta Gamma house, but her coifed hair and perfect makeup make me feel self-conscious. She waves from the hostess desk and I attempt to straighten out my wrinkled blouse before she sits down. “What’d you think?” she says before even pulling out a chair. “Gorgeous as always.” I place a hand over my coffee cup as Dolores arrives, hovering her pot across the table like an alien spaceship and sending me a suspicious glance. “The customer service is exceptional, Mary Jo McConnell.” Hearing the name, Dolores jerks to get a better look at my table companion. Mary Jo is clueless, but Dolores suddenly resorts back to her cheerful self.  “Would you like some coffee, Miss Mary Jo?” “No thanks, Dolores. I’m just here to see how my travel writer friend’s stay is going.” Mary Jo pronounces my new profession like my family does, as if I’ve decided to become a ventriloquist or palm reader for an occupation. I’ve been writing travel stories for years, bringing in extra income to my well-paying newspaper job covering the school board and police beat in deep St. Bernard Parish for the New Orleans Post. The Post is the smaller city newspaper to the notable Times-Picayune. Note sarcasm here: the pay sucked, we were but a shadow to the Times-Pic and guess who’s up for a Pulitzer for their Katrina coverage? My twin Sebastian thought my day job would produce fodder for the Great American Novel I was to write and my dad called it “a decent job and I should be glad to have one.” I saw it as newspaper hell. But I dismiss Mary Jo’s obvious doubting of me making a living at freelance travel writing, instead catching how Dolores is now doubly scared because she’s finally figured out I may write about her. She starts fussing over me and I wonder if, as a travel writer, I will have this power over people from now on. Cool. Mary Jo shushes her away and I explain how my suite overlooking Royal Street delighted every sense (all true), the rooftop pool was heavenly (too crowded and noisy but the drinks helped make that go away), my massage the night before couldn’t have been better (again, no lie, although that poor woman got her money’s worth working on me) and two small children kept me up all night running down the hall. I left that last part out. Either the hotel’s haunted or there are parents here waking from a good night’s sleep that I want to throttle. Once we get awkward business out of the way and I assure her a story is forthcoming in Mais Yeah!, the southwest Louisiana weekly I now write travel for, we catch up on girlfriend news. Mary Jo shows off her enormous diamond and grabs my day planner to circle the date of her upcoming wedding. Branford J. Whitaker the third, otherwise known as “Brick” — I don’t inquire — heads up his father’s Carnival store, the kind that sells all that China-made crap thrown at Mardi Gras parades, those lovely beads, doubloons, trinkets and the like that everyone kills each other over and then stuffs into attics like Christmas decorations. “There’s so much money in Carnival,” Mary Jo informs me. “You wouldn’t believe how much those krewe members spend on throws.” She leans in close and whispers with a sly smile, “Thousands and thousands, which is great for the Whitaker family.” I really shouldn’t have blurted it out, but I had to stop the jealousy rising in my chest. As much as I love my new freedom and finally realizing my dream, I’m scared as hell at the lack of financial security and I’m trying hard not to remember that fact. “You did what?” Mary Jo asks me, which surprises me as much as TB’s reaction. “I don’t understand why this is such a surprise.” “Viola, you’re upset because of the disaster,” she says, patting my hand. “The loss of your house, “It’s a mother-in-law unit,” I answer way too defensively. My mother calls my home in the neighboring town of Lafayette a potting shed because of its ruggedness — okay, it’s a bit frayed at the edges — and refuses to set foot inside. Which turned out to be a good thing; my parents never visit. “Deliah said it was a dump.” “You talked to my mother?” “I can find you a really nice place in New Orleans....” “Can’t afford it now that I’ve gone freelance. You talked to my mother?” Mary Jo takes my hand and squeezes. “We’re worried about you.” I pull my hand back and offer up my best “life is good, what hurricane?” smile. Nothing is taking me down today. “My landlord is letting me live there free in exchange for keeping an eye on the big house,” I say, trying to eliminate the defensive edge from my voice. It could have been a closet and I would have eagerly agreed. Well, it kinda is. “It’s part of the freedom package that’s allowing me to work as a travel writer and not go back to that horrid newsroom,” I continue. “You know how miserable I was.” Mary Jo tilts her head as if to start a “Yes, but....” “Did I tell you that Reece, my Cajun landlord, isn’t hard on the eyes?” Wrong thing to say when you’re fresh into a separation. “This is all too soon to be thinking of dating your landlord, Vi.” “Who said dating? He’s married.” Mary Jo winces. “Maybe you and TB should get counseling.” “You never liked TB,” I add. “Since when are you taking his side?” TB stands for T-Bubba. My ex loves to joke about his name, calling himself half Cajun, half redneck since the Cajun “T” stands for “petite,” or “Petite (Little) Bubba.” His father, the redneck half, was Bubba Senior. My mom calls TB a disease. Mary Jo huffs while shaking a packet of Sweet-n-Low before ripping off the side and pouring the cancerous substance into her coffee. Just watching her sip that pink stuff leaves an awful aftertaste in my mind and I swallow hard. “A divorce is a pretty big step,” she says. “And you just went through a traumatic experience. You don’t need to pile more stress on your life.” What’s a little more stress after axing your way through an attic when lake waters rushed through your home, to sit on a rooftop for two days while your government ignored you? Not knowing where your twin brother was for more than a week. In fact, now that Sebastian is working as a temp in the restaurant industry and moving around the Deep South, I still don’t know. “I’ll be fine.” Weirdly enough, I actually believe that, feel infinitely better. The future is unstable but the possibilities are endless. Mary Jo doesn’t share in my excitement. The light behind her eyes disappear, replaced by a comatose stare she once exhibited when she thought Lampton “Scoop” Mallard over at the KA house was having an affair. Goosebumps run up my arm and panic fills my chest. “Is this about Lillye?” she asks quietly. Time to leave. I check my watch. “I need to go. My plane leaves at ten.” “Viola.” Mary Jo grabs my hand as I rise. “This is all so horrible. You lost everything and now you’re getting a divorce and living in someone’s potting shed.” I give her a kiss on the cheek, knowing she means well. I have my photos. Really, what else matters? “I’ll be fine,” I say. Mary Jo grins through the tears; she really is a good friend. I give her a tight hug and roll my pink and white polka dot luggage I nabbed at Goodwill to the Honda that TB had insisted I keep (he’s spending his share of the FEMA money on a pickup). I have to stop by the house and give TB the mail, since mail service in New Orleans is spotty at best. Our insurance check finally arrived, so I need to hand it off to TB before I fly out so he can continue renovations. I drive through the tourist-infested French Quarter amazed at how the lure of Bourbon Street keeps them coming no matter what. Good thing our founding fathers settled the heart of the city above sea level. You’d never know a disaster happened gazing out at the crowds strolling through the ancient quarter, giant drinks shaped like bombs in their hands, those tacky beads around their necks making the Whitakers rich, and silly grins produced when alcohol mixes with the freedom to be whoever you wish to be. The closer I get to Rampart, however, the more damage I spot, blue tarps on the roofs to keep the rain out, piles of mildewed sheetrock by the curb. I turn and head over to Canal and move toward the lakeside of town, an area called Mid-City where TB and I lived. The waterline is evident here, like a child extended his hand with a pen between his fingers, letting it mark up the sides of houses. The further west I travel, the higher the mark, like I’m slowly descending under water and into hell. In fact, I am. All that euphoria of staying at the elegant, historic Monteleone Hotel in the heart of the romantic French Quarter disappears and the horror of Katrina stares back at me everywhere. I swallow hard, fighting down the bile and panic as I gaze at the blocks upon blocks of water-logged homes and the empty shopping centers and dead traffic lights. One corner still sports an abandoned boat from the rescue days. A pack of dogs runs wild down Iberville Street. A billboard blown free of its tethers has landed in a housetop and I see a smiling woman enjoying coffee peeking out by the chimney. This is what Mary Jo and my mother want me to live in. I vow to hand TB his mail and haul ass to the airport. He must have heard me drive up for TB is halfway to the curb by the time I turn off the engine. I’m not happy to see him and that old guilt comes back with a rush. I could write a dissertation on why my marriage failed, but sum it up with one sentence: The man aggravates the hell out of me. For years I tried to hide it, put “a nice face on” as my mother would say, but the nastiness in my voice bubbles to the surface and pours out, sometimes in turrets. Before I’m able to grab the mail and lock up the car, TB’s staring at me over the hood. “Mary Jo called in tears, said she’s worried about you.”I groan, pushing the lock button on the door; I wasn’t able to afford one of those push-button kind you carry on a key chain. I even roll down my windows the old-fashioned way. “What could possibly be wrong?” I ask TB sarcastically, laughing. “She said you’re on your way somewhere.” I don’t feel like explaining to the world where I am and what I’m doing because family and friends keep trying to talk me out of it. And get counseling. Both of which I don’t intend to do. Even though TB’s motivation is to get me back into the marriage, I keep it simple. “I’m going on a press trip.” “Oh yeah, what for?” Here come the twenty questions. TB’s idea of a conversation is asking mundane questions, like a three-year-old following a parent around the house. “What are you doing?” “What’s your plans for today?” “What do you want to do for dinner?” “Was that the mail?” “I got invited to go somewhere, to do a travel story,” I tell him. “Where are you going?” I shouldn’t have blurted it out but my multi-tasking brain is busy focusing on getting to the sidewalk and not on the elderly man across the street staring. A shiver runs up my spine as I feel those cold black eyes upon me. “I’m heading to Eureka Springs, Arkansas.” “What for?” I pull TB through our front gate and head up toward the house, glancing back to see if the old man is still there. He is. And his gaze still bores holes into my back. “Who is that?” I whisper to TB. “Who is what?"" A normal person would have had trouble comprehending how TB could have missed this intense weirdo across the street, but TB is regularly clueless. I turn toward the house but pause at the porch and hand TB the mail.“Aren’t you coming in?” “Uh, no.” I had seen all I had wanted of our house about a month after Katrina, when they finally let residents into the parish to view what was left — if anything — of their homes. Weeks under water can do amazing things to a person’s belongings, like a stick of butter in the microwave left on high too long. I don’t want to step foot in that house again. TB marches up the steps. “Want to see what I’ve done with the kitchen? I painted the cabinets and found some nice granite pieces half price.” I’m not following. “Really? I need to get to the airport.” He nods but I can tell he wants to talk, try to convince me a legal separation isn’t the best route. Thankfully my trip to the courthouse last week sealed the deal. “Your mother said we need time.” My head snaps to attention. “What? You talked to my mother?” “For a woman who routinely left me places as a child because she was too busy practicing speeches for her TV appearances, I doubt she’s worried.” “You should give her a break,” TB says. “Tulane hasn’t asked her back.” I’m sorry my mother is out of a job, really, but whose side is she on? She hates TB, convinced I had married beneath me, which is probably true. Now, he’s her best friend? I nod at the mail in his hands. “The insurance check is on top.” “I finished the second floor. You’ll hardly recognize it.” “Uh, huh.” I turn back toward the street and the creepy old man has reappeared on the porch next door. I can’t get to my car, out of the Katrina zone and to the airport fast enough. “Don’t you want to even look?” “Nope.” I head to the front gate but I can tell TB is hot on my heels. “What are you doing again?” “I told you, a travel writing thing,” I shout out without turning around. I can’t bear seeing that man again, or pondering how a man his age moved so fast. “Like the ones I used to do on the side, although this one is an organized press trip.” “Where are you staying?” “The Crescent Hotel.” Crap. I feel like Homer Simpson after he says something truly stupid. Why did I just tell TB that? I make it to the driver’s side and gaze up at him over the hood. He stands there like a puppy dog wanting a bone. “Can I come?” Travel writers on press trips receive everything complimentary — accommodations, food, plane tickets. Guests are not allowed. Usually, the tourist bureaus foot the bill and they are not about to spend valuable dollars on people who won’t write about the place. I’ve heard about husbands or wives posing as photographers but that’s about the extent of it. TB had accompanied me once on a trip I arranged on my own, and I hated every minute. I wanted to explore, he wanted to drink and sit by the pool. I wanted to enjoy a nice meal and examine the place on my own, he blurted out to everyone that I was there on assignment so every member of the restaurant visited our table. The next time I arranged an excursion I conveniently planned it over a weekend during football season, knowing well TB wouldn’t give up valuable couch time. “No, you can’t come,” I tell him tersely. “I could stay in the room, not bother you....” “No.” “I could just hang by the pool....” I hate to do it but the look on TB’s face, the putrid smell of mildew and decay and that horrid man’s stare make me slip in my car and drive off without another word. I have a plane to catch and nothing is getting me down today, I practically yell inside my head. The guilt is eating me alive and it takes everything not to gaze in the rearview mirror. “Call your mom,” I hear TB shout out, as I turn the corner and head back to the interstate. I’m late getting to the airport, mainly because my mother called twice and I fumbled with my purse trying to silence the damn cell phone. The distraction made me miss my exit and I ended up circling Kenner needlessly. When I finally park, get through security and make it to my gate, I have minutes to spare. I drop my bag at my feet, fall into the chair and breathe deeply, startling the well-dressed man across from me whose right eyebrow raises without him looking up from his laptop. “Finally,” I say to no one and the man shifts in his chair. Am I bothering him? Doesn’t matter. I’m free of my ex-husband, my overbearing family, my well-meaning friends pushing psychoanalysis and the putrid wrath that was Katrina and on my way to a new adventure and career. And that’s when she started singing.

Chapter 2
A woman about my age, soaking wet, stands dripping in the aisle outside my gate, belting out You Are My Sunshine at the top of her lungs. She looks me straight in the eyes, water leaking off the ends of her stringy black hair, puddles appearing at her bare feet, and explains how I make her happy when skies are gray. I look around to see if anyone else is watching this woman sing the Louisiana state song written by a former governor, her arms outstretched for emphasis when she hits “You’ll never know, dear, how much I love you,” but no one seems to notice her. A mother and daughter play with an American Girl doll to my right, a businessman devours a biscuit and sausage to my left and Mr. Fancy Pants continues reading his laptop. Usually I ignore the crazies in New Orleans, too, especially in Louis Armstrong Airport where half of the tourists are glazed and hung over and the other still fresh and slobbering from a night on Bourbon Street. The ones arriving have that get-me-a-drink look and who knows what for a motive so their focus is elsewhere. But this woman is soaked head to toe, looking positively frightened or agitated or both and singing as if her life depends on it. I lean over to search the airport corridors and two cops are laughing over coffee around Gate Number Four. Esther Williams is still singing and neither one looks in her direction. Weird. The gate agents are busy sliding boarding passes into the machine and a security guard drives up in one of those pseudo golf carts but no one even glances in this poor lady’s direction. Just when I am about to get up and see if I can be of assistance, Mr. Fancy Pants across from me, his head still bent toward his laptop in engrossed concentration, lifts his right hand and snaps his fingers. One simple gesture, and the singing stops. The woman appears as if she’s been slapped, her eyes registering intense pain. She bows her head in failure and moves away, her feet leaving prints as she meanders down the aisle. I glance back at Fancy Pants, whose hand has returned to his side, his gaze never leaving the screen, until they call Zone Three. He closes his laptop and rises, never glancing in my direction, heading to the ticket agent as if nothing had happened. When I check back on the wet opera singer, she’s gone. Vanished. Maybe my family and friends are right, I think, wondering where I put that card Mary Jo gave me, the one for the counselor specializing in post traumatic stress disorder. But that woman was standing in the aisle in front of me, singing to the heavens. I know what I saw. And if I’m not totally nuts Mr. Fancy Pants heard her too. I’m so confused and, like a good journalist, totally curious, but it’s time to get on the plane and start my new career. I sneak one last look down the airport corridor, even check for footprints, shake my head and hand the gate attendant my boarding pass. Once aboard, I have other things to worry about. I end up lodged between an overweight man hogging the armrest and an elderly woman knitting. I practically wrap my elbows around my chest like a true crazy person and attempt to read my “S” book, something light and funny with cartoon women on the cover with words like “sassy,” “seductive” and “scandalizing” among the back cover’s description. S books make me happy, take me away from waterlines and levee breaches and I’m not going to apologize for it like most women I know and call it “trash.” Right now these books are better than Prosac. I’m so enraptured in the hunk who runs the town newspaper and his fight with the spirited yet intelligent heroine of the mayor’s office that we land in the Northwest Arkansas airport in no time at all, a good-sized facility in a rural area near Bentonville and Rogers, places most people have never heard of unless they work for Walmart. Bentonville was home to entrepreneur Sam Walton who started the multi-national chain and thus the town became the operational hub of the megastores. Because Walton insisted companies move to the area if they wanted to be part of his dream, and all these new businesses plus Walmart need transportation services, the lovely new airport was built. Too bad New Orleans never had such pull, I think, as I head down impeccable marble aisles toward the baggage claim. The Crescent City had long outgrown its airport and progressive politicians had suggested a larger international airport almost halfway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans with a light rail in between but the idea never took. As usual not enough money. Or forward thinking. Plus, there was that time after Katrina when the airport became a hospital and morgue so right now all everyone’s thinking about is getting it back to normal. I wasn’t going to think about New Orleans on this trip, or my flooded home, lack of a steady job and the fact that my electricity would get cut off if my FEMA check didn’t arrive soon. Tonight I would sleep between layers of multi-thread linens and indulge in fine cuisine while PR people drive me around, line up interviews and pay for everything. Only in America could writers straddling the poverty line be wined and dined at posh hotels and four-star restaurants in fun destinations. “It doesn’t get better than this,” I whisper to myself. Travel writing was my dream in college, a career I wanted to start the moment that journalism diploma hit my greedy little hands. But it’s not something you major in, interview for and start the next day. You could nab a similar position at a magazine or become a newspaper travel editor, and lord knows I tried getting on at Southern Living and the Times-Picayune travel section for years. Or you could do what I did and cover the cops beat in St. Bernard Parish for the New Orleans Post while writing travel on the side for the Sunday edition and a few other small magazines and newspapers. That’s how I met Henry Torrington Wallace. I had driven to Birmingham for a journalism conference and took some side trips to compile into a feature for the Martin Luther King Jr. birthday weekend. The travel piece garnered a Louisiana Press Award and Henry called to ask if I wanted to join his agency’s press trip to Nashville. I wasn’t able to accept free trips at the time — against newspaper policy — but I kept his card just in case. Needless to say, my cops job in St. Bernard Parish washed away, pun so very much intended. Good riddance. Once I got established in Lafayette, Henry was the first person I rang. “I’m freelancing now for the chain in southwest Louisiana and a few magazines,” I told him. “Got any trips in the Deep South?” Did he ever. I was in business before you can say, “Your hotel room is complimentary.” I grab my polka dot bag and do as instructed, travel to the baggage claim and look for signs from Henry’s PR agency, the Wallace Group. As expected, Henry is waiting at the bottom of the escalator, his arms full of press packets. He tilts his chin up at me and I smile, tingling with excitement. I can feel those silky-smooth sheets already, after which I will relax in a bathtub full of free upscale products. For not the first time I wonder if the other journalists — those working at travel writing longer than me or who live in equally nice residences — feel the same rush when they exit the plane knowing what’s coming. “How’ve you been, Viola?” Henry asks me after an obligatory hug. His agency hails from Tennessee, so he’s Southern to the core. He also pronounces my name correctly: VIE-O-LA. “I’m great, Henry.” If only he knew just how, staring down at a press kit announcing “Heaven in the Ozarks!” “Is this it?” He grabs the handle of the polka dot bag and heads toward the exit. “I always travel light,” I say apologetically. Do other journalists bring more? What’s funny is that practically everything I own is in that bag. You know I’m not kidding. “Am I the only pick-up?” As soon as I ask, I realize two other travel writers are waiting by the door, a dark-haired woman dressed in a Talbots-style outfit complete with high heels and several layers of gold necklaces, intent on text messaging on what looks like a Blackberry (I honestly don’t know, never had the money to buy one), and an older man in jeans and a Lacosse shirt scoping out the local newspaper container. I smooth down the designer linen shirt I found at Goodwill, sorry for my choice since traveling between those two armrest hogs has rendered it a massive wave of wrinkles. I also worry about my tried and true Converse sneakers my mother calls adolescent. These days, I don’t care what my mother calls my clothes but I’m self-conscious around these people. “Small news hole,” the tall guy says without looking up. I extend my hand. “Viola Valentine.” Tall guy ignores me. “I hate it when they put ads on the front page.” “Richard Cambry,” Henry explains, then nods his head toward texting queen. “And Irene Fisher.” “Nice to meet you,” I say, but only Irene responds, without looking up. Ah, a nice polite bunch. We make our way to the van, one Henry has rented for the trip, and the Friendlys deposit their bags at the back while Richard talks about his newspaper days and grabs the front seat. Irene sighs and mutters something under her breath. “Do you need help?” I ask Henry, who gives me a sweet “Are you kidding, get in the van” look. He opens my door and I do the obligatory Southern conversation, asking about his wife, his job and Henry gives me a quick roundup with a smile.“Don’t we have to be there by four,” Richard asks from inside the van. “I don’t know, just saying. It has four on the schedule.” Henry smiles politely as only PR people can do; it’s an amazing talent they own, being able to offer impeccable customer service in the presence of assholes. “Be right back,” Henry says and heads back inside the airport. You’d think plum assignments such as these would render people gracious and thankful, but there are jerks in the best of professions, and plenty of folks who need bibs and bottles. Now realize, we must have credentials and extensive work experiences to be asked on press trips, not to mention there is an art to this craft most people don’t understand. No, it’s not about writing what you did on vacation. But come on, folks. When someone’s paying the bill, lining up interviews and driving you around in a van where you don’t even have to wear a seatbelt, the least you can do is be polite and grateful. Leave your whining at home. I enter the van and park next to Irene, who finishes her text and looks up. “Irene Fisher,” she announces, holding out her hand. I skip the reminder that we’ve already met and shake her hand, but dear old Richard doesn’t miss a thing. “We had introductions in the airport, Irene. If you weren’t so busy on that cell phone….” Richard must be around sixty or seventy with a head full of white hair to back up that statement and he launches into a tirade about young people and cell phones, using a woman not paying attention while driving as an example. From the way he describes this female, I pick up chauvinistic sentiments, not to mention arrogance and conceit. I didn’t like him back at the newspaper. Now I really don’t. Irene tunes him out but he keeps shifting in his seat to look at me. Just for fun, I ask if he’s married. “Who knows?” he answers, leaving this balloon of a thought floating above us. As if synchronized, Irene and I gaze at each other and silently vote not to pop that bubble. The pause we offer makes Richard uncomfortable so he launches into a lengthy explanation, mostly about how difficult women are to live with and how his wife is at fault for everything. Irene begins texting again and I stare out the window, noticing how rural the surrounding area is, when who should saunter by but Mr. Fancy Pants. He pauses at the van door with his laptop and garment bag — do people use those anymore? — and leans his head in to greet us. It’s the first time I get a good look at his face, which is handsome with sleek, sculptured lines, a no-nonsense countenance although I detect a slyness lurking beneath. His salt and pepper hair is perfectly combed back, a bit of a white streak happening around one temple but this guy plays it up, embracing what I suspect is early middle age. His green-gray eyes match the whole ensemble, as if he did it on purpose. My gay-dar is beeping rapidly. “You all remember Carmine Kelsey,” Henry says, adding for me, “and this is Viola Valentine. The Arkansas trip is her first with us.”
Carmine looks me in the eye for the first time, albeit briefly, raising one eyebrow. The atmosphere feels uncomfortable. I’m not sure if it’s because everyone now knows I’m a newbie to this business or Carmine had witnessed the wet opera singer. I realize someone must move to the back row to accommodate Carmine, so I take the opportunity to break gaze, stumbling into the back, the pieces of my press packet flying all over the floor. “Nice to meet you too,” he says, which garners a laugh from Richard and Irene, and I immediately dislike the man. As I rearrange my belongings and attempt to tame my now horribly wrinkled shirt, Henry jumps in the front and off we go. Richard begins a long discourse on the state of travel writing today and Henry politely listens while Irene and Carmine take to their electronics. I want desperately to ask Carmine about the wet apparition in the airport, but on the flip side, from his haughty demeanor and sarcastic snide, I want to cross him off my list with the rest of the van’s occupants. Instead, I enjoy the rolling countryside of northwest Arkansas with the budding sycamore and maple trees, fields full of rolled hay and nonchalant cows and little rolling streams crossing the highway. We pass lovely farmhouses where people reside with all their belongings, photos carefully preserved in family albums."
Anais of Brightshire,"Chapter 1





THIS WAS MY fifth trip to Brightshire with my Uncle Gil, and with each return trip home, my mother became more distressed that I would never be accepted into the Great House as a handmaiden. My mother had been a handmaiden before she married my father and thought she was doing me a great service by insisting I follow in her footsteps. At the age of eleven, I was no longer a child, and my mother had made it quite clear that I was expected to find work outside of our home. My feelings on the matter were mixed. I wished to please my mother, but I didn’t think it was fair that I had to abandon my life to do so.

“You alright back there, girlie?” Gil called from the front of the cart, where he led the mules along the bumpy road. “That was a nasty bit of wind.”

I lowered the blanket from my face. “Mm, I’m okay.” I narrowed my eyes and imagined him as a walrus, which made me giggle. Gil had grown a long mustache that ended in a wide curl on each end. He was much larger than my father and brothers, who were as skinny as weeds and taut with muscles earned from the harsh life of fishermen. Gil’s grin stretched wide from ear to ear. Gil was always bursting with city gossip or a cheerful song. My mother often alleged that it was Gil’s ever-flowing supply of ale that caused him to find such pleasure in life. Gil was unlike my father in other ways too. He often suggested odd schemes to Dah, including a plan to dry fish in foreign spices. And once he told us a story of an inventor from a shire west of the Barrier Mountains who had built a box that would keep food cold indefinitely. Dah always scoffed at these plans, preferring to deal exclusively with smoking or boiling. Mah and Dah had no desire to foray into the unknown, whereas Gil was a dreamer.

Dawn emerged on the eastern horizon, and I heard the blurred sounds of carts, horses, mules, and voices - city noises.

Gil turned back and eyed me. “We’re almost to town. Today will be mighty busy. A lot of business to be had.” Gil whistled a tune as he led the mules around a sharp right turn.

I peeked out of my blanket again and caught the smells of the market wafting toward me. Thick odors of people and animals blurred with the sweet and salty aromas of market food. Brightshire Bazaar stalls contained every imaginable food stock: the ripest plum-berries from north of Barriershire, the sweetest cream from the Moore Dairy, the moistest lamb from Blumstead Farms, the finest vintages of Brightshire wines, and - of course - the freshest fish to be had from the Bright River. My eyes glazed with excitement as the town clarified.

A large brick archway signified our entrance into the city, and as we passed through, the dirt path transitioned into a cobbled stone. Two men, dressed in red jackets with gold plated buttons and crisp black pants sporting thin curved swords, nodded to Gil after he showed them his trader’s papers. A man dressed in a crimson robe spoke to Gil for a few minutes and looked over our cargo. He was a sniffer. Gil had told me on our first trip that the man in the robe was sniffing for artifacts holding enchantments. Because magic was prohibited, if we were caught carrying contraband, we would likely be executed. Gil had promised that it was nothing to worry about since there was no magic left in the world, and the sniffers were all frauds.

We worked our way from the city entrance toward the bazaar. A smile crept to my face. I felt like a small cog in the machine of commerce whenever we visited, and I appreciated that feeling of inclusion. I liked to watch large sums of coin change hands. I sighed. It must be wonderful to have money. The surge of adrenaline coursing through my veins was hampered by the knowledge that when the stalls closed, Gil would bring me to the Great House again. Would they take me this time? I half hoped so. I didn’t want to see my mother’s face fall in disappointment once again, but the notion also scared me. I would be a stranger here. I would be alone.

Gil pulled the mules to a stop next to a muddy square occupied by an empty wooden stall. Ambitious merchants had already filled the other stalls in the row with their goods, and I knew Gil would soon transform our space into the greatest fish stall in the entire Brightshire Bazaar. I dropped my blanket and hopped off the cart, landing softly on the cobbled stone floor. Gil took longer to pull his hefty frame to the ground. By the time he was off the wagon, I was standing in front of him with outstretched hands.

“Here you go, girlie.” He dropped four copper coins into my small hands. “Sign us up.” I knew that Gil trusted me, and I felt full of pride as I took off in a fast tripping gait towards the Bazaar master. The Bazaar master’s name was Harry and the name fit, for he was covered from head to toe with coarse brown hair. Harry was also a dwarf, the only dwarf I had ever met. Gil had lectured me sharply that I shouldn’t stare or comment. I hesitated before I approached him.

“You again, huh?” Harry asked as I reached the front of the line.

“Yeah, I’m with Gil. We took stall nine on the main strip. It’ll be a fish stall.”

Harry smiled. “That’ll be just fine - four coppers please - and you need to sign the registry.” I dropped the coins into his hand. Using a quill still felt daunting as I had only learned how to sign my name five weeks ago when Gil had taken me to Brightshire for the first time. My cheeks flushed hot and pink at the sight of my poorly formed letters.

By the time I returned to our stall, Gil had everything organized. The biggest fish hung from broad iron hooks on the highest wooden plank, and assorted fish were artfully arranged in wooden bins. The majority of the fish stayed tightly wrapped to avoid spoiling in the heat the day would bring. Gil wrote a single word in bright red paint on a large plank of wood that spanned the front of our stall. I wanted to know what the word meant, but I felt too embarrassed to ask.

Feeling anxious, I stood next to Gil while waiting for our first customer. My eyes drifted to our neighboring traders: a young man boasting dyed cloth, a wizened old woman with a huge variety of fresh spring vegetables, and a squirrelly looking man selling jewelry and foreign coins. The man selling cloth tempted market goers with long scarlet scarves gently floating from his hands. I wished I could have one. I had never seen anything so bright and perfect.

Gil boomed in a deep voice that must have echoed through all of Brightshire, “Fresh fish! Get your fresh fish! Tastiest fish in all of the Seven Shires!”

Our first customer was a young woman with three children in tow. The woman bought two large catfish that Gil claimed he was giving away at the bargain price of two coppers apiece. Though, I knew that two coppers was the standard price for a large catfish. Soon our stall was flooded with local townspeople and travelers. I sold a bag of shrimp, three large crabs, and two cod all on my own as Gil helped other customers.

A tall gangly youth approached our stand. He let his long arms rest against a bin filled with shrimp. “Shyte, Gil it’s good to see you.”

“You too, kiddo. Where have you been?”

“Dah and I were out near the border towns for the last few weeks. The wheat crops just came in.” The boy swayed back and forth as if uncomfortable standing still.

Gil frowned. “That’s late for the border towns.”

“Yeah well, things have been strange near the border - all sorts of delays. You see, a few of the farmer’s kids disappeared. Just vanished.”

“Runaways?”

“Nah. One of the farmers said it was some sort of monster. They found one of his kids tore up real bad, but still alive. And the kid told him that an - an animal, or monster,” the boy shuttered, “or maybe even a fury crawled out of the darkness and grabbed him and his two brothers right out of the barn in the dead of night.”

“What happened to the kid’s brothers?” Gil’s eyes narrowed.

The boy scratched his head. “Still gone. The border families held a service for them. I guess the farmers figure those kids ain’t never coming back.”

“They believed the kid then? His story?”

“Yeah. Guess so. There are other kids down there gone missing. Dah says we aren’t going back next season, or ever. Dah’s gonna move the family north, maybe even across the mountains to Courtshire. This might be our last market day.”

“Really?” Gil snorted. “Your Dah should know better. There’s no such thing as monsters and certainly no furies, just bad people. And there are bad people everywhere. I’ll talk to your Dah. The kid was lying or just confused.”

The boy smiled weakly. “Maybe you can talk him into staying. Mah is real upset. She doesn’t want to leave.” The boy paused, his eyes darting around nervously. “I don’t wanna leave either. There’s Mary, and if I go, I fear she’ll forget about me.”

Gil nodded. “I’ll talk to him, kiddo. I promise.”

Wordlessly, I watched this interchange play out. I didn’t like the idea of people disappearing. It made me think of the scary stories Mah would sometimes tell about monsters that would steal children in the dead of night. She also called them furies. She said that their skin was green-black and slick like a lizard. They had sharp hooked claws and a mouth so crammed full of teeth that there didn’t seem to be room for anything else. Otherwise, she said, they were shaped like men but stooped by the weight of evil deeds. She said they hadn’t been sighted in generations, but still it was always the reason she gave for us to stay inside once the sky turned dark. She would sing this awful song about them. I shuttered. I wondered if this boy’s family told the same stories. Despite my uncertainty, I took strength in Gil’s words that this too was just a story. Not real. There was something certain in his assessment. He didn’t believe in monsters. So neither would I - at least I would try not to.

After the boy left us, Gil told me he needed me to watch the stand, so that he could purchase goods for my family and our neighbors who also made their living from the Bright River and its easy access to the ocean. Gil had left me in charge for a short time on our previous trips, so I was prepared to run the stand in his absence. He had trained me in acceptable price ranges for all our goods.

While Gil was absent, Fraenkle, an elderly trader whose white curly hair masked most of the features of his face, appeared and bought two small crabs and a haddock. Fraenkle was a regular who ran a small general goods shop south of the main strip. He doffed his cap, offered me a broad smile, and wiggled his thick white eyebrows. He must have done this to suggest that he was friendly and would, therefore, be an easy mark, but I knew he was a shrewd trader. Fraenkle bargained long and hard to get the best deal out of me.

When Gil returned, he patted me gently on the head. I could tell that he appreciated the sales I made, and I felt proud. He dropped a warm copper into my palm. “Go on now, and enjoy yourself for a bit.” I beamed. This was my favorite part of the day. I maneuvered through the narrow lanes between stalls, which were teaming with country folk, a handful of wealthy squires, and even a few men in velvet suits and pluming white cravats, whom I imagined might be nobles from the Great House.

In the crowd, a boy dressed in dirty coveralls shoved me, forcing me to drop my copper. Another boy snatched it from the ground and started running off into the distance. I hissed, wishing my mother hadn’t insisted I wear skirts today. Three underskirts of rough cotton billowed under my top skirt. I often wore my brothers’ old trousers when at home because they were so much more comfortable, but my mother would not tolerate my careless attitude towards my appearance during my journeys to Brightshire. I sighed, hiked up my skirts, and took off in a run after the boy who had stolen my coin. I wove through the crowd, keeping him in sight. Eventually he stopped running, and I slowed my gait to match his. He stopped in front of a group of brightly dressed jugglers who were passing knives to each other through the air. I chose the moment when he was clearly distracted to jump on his back and pummel him.

“What - what’re you doing? You’re crazy!” The boy yelled as he tried to throw me off his back.

“I want my copper back. You stole it.” I whacked him on the head as hard as I could. “Give it back!”

The crowd parted a little, and I could feel the stares of those around us. Their gazes were silent. No one interfered.

“Okay, okay. I’ll give it back, if it means so much to you. Just stop hitting me,” the boy cried.

I climbed off his back, hopped to the ground, and took the copper he reluctantly offered. “Thanks.” I smiled quickly, stuffed the copper down a pocket in my skirts, and bowed before running away from the boy.

My nose led me to a pastry stall where I bought myself a peach tart. I found an untended wagon and climbed into it so that I could enjoy my purchase while spying on the crowd. Sweet gooeyness spilled out of the crusty edges of the tart and into my hands, and I sucked the juice from my fingers. I found myself staring at a young woman dressed in a delicate yellow gown, embroidered with a gold edging. I had often helped my mother sew clothes for our family out of coarse homespun cloth, but I had never seen anything like the sleek and shimmery material that draped the noblewoman’s slim frame. I could not help but think it must be close to heaven to wear something so fine.

I pushed back strands of limp, black hair from my eyes with sticky fingers, so that my view of the woman would not be impaired. I watched the woman advance through the crowd while deftly controlling the flow of the panels of her skirts, which flirted with the cobbled stone floor. A deep surge of envy pulsed through my veins; at that moment, I wished I could trade places with the woman. I searched out her sparkling blue eyes, and the woman looked through me as if I were invisible. I hated thinking of myself as so utterly inconsequential. The young lady’s companion, an elegantly dressed young man, led her through the crowd until the two disappeared. I envied them, and a part of me hated them.

As I walked back to our stall, I passed by a puddle and stared at my rippling reflection. Even my eyes were unimpressive, a dull ashy gray. I could not look more different from the noblewoman. Knowing the certainty of my common birth and lack of beauty, I couldn’t help but feel empty. I closed my eyes and let the shifting cadence of the market break my heartache. I needed to stop wishing for a life that was not mine.

Lost in reverie, I bumped headlong into a large cage on wheels that a dwarf was pulling through the street.

“Careful there, girlie,” he called out. “You don’t want to get too close.”

I peered through the thick wooden bars, and saw a boy, maybe as old as my eldest brother. He was dressed in filthy rags and crouched in the corner. Thick metal bands were wrapped round his neck and round his wrists. His skin was thick with sweat, and his head lolled back and forth, his eyes fixed on the bottom of the cage. He looked so thin, so helpless.

I gasped. “Why is he in there?”

“He’s a fury, I swear it. I bought him from some outlaws near the border towns. They captured him.”

“Shyte. He’s not a fury - he’s just a boy. Can’t you see that? You need to let him out right now. You can’t keep him trapped like this.”

The man laughed at me. “You don’t know anything, girlie. Why don’t you take a good look at him, and you tell me if he’s normal? I’m going to take him to Barriershire and sell him.”

I stared through the bars. “Look at me,” I whispered to him. “Please look at me. What’s your name?” I touched his hands, which grasped the bars so tight they had lost all of their color.

“Azriel,” he croaked in a hoarse whisper. His head turned slowly, and when his eyes met mine, I jumped back in revulsion. I couldn’t help it, my stomach tightened, and I suddenly wanted to flee. It wasn’t that he looked sickly or ugly. He was almost too handsome, with sharp hawkish features, which couldn’t be disguised by the layers of grime covering his face. But despite his prettiness, his eyes were not right; they were too large and all black. I knew he wasn’t right, wasn’t human. How strange. I closed my eyes and breathed in deeply, steadying myself.

“Told you, girlie. He’s a monster alright.” The dwarf started to pull the cage in his original direction.

“Wait,” I whispered. The dwarf didn’t hear me, but in truth, I wouldn’t have known what else to say to him. There was nothing I could do to free the boy - and I wasn’t sure I wanted to save him.

Gil looked up at the fading sun after I returned to our stall. “Only a few more hours until the sun goes to sleep for the night. We need to get you to the Great House before nightfall.” He smiled at me. “I just know they’ll take you this time.”





Chapter 2





THE GREAT HOUSE, with its black stone turrets that scraped the sky and its thick red-rimmed defensive-walls, made even Gil, who towered over me, appear insignificant. At the rear servant’s entrance, Gil requested the mistress of the house, and I was reminded of my first visit when I mistook the grand lady who answered our call for Lady Seve herself. Gil had explained that the woman was Mistress Laurey, the head of housekeeping. Lady Seve didn’t answer the bells rung in the servant’s quarters.

Mistress Laurey appeared in a stiff black dress adorned with a long line of ivory buttons. Her dark red hair was pulled back in a severe bun, which pulled the skin of her face taut against her high cheekbones. Looking at Gil and me, she sighed deeply.

“How can I help you?”

“We wish to place my niece into your household as a handmaiden.”

The woman laughed. “Rather presumptuous notions you have. I remember you now. Remind me of the girl’s age.”

“Eleven years.” Gil removed his hat and grasped it in front of him, his knuckles whitening.

Mistress Laurey was clean, and she held her frame as straight as an arrow. In many ways, her bearing resembled that of the noble girl I had observed in the market.

“She’s small.” Mistress Laurey’s lips tightened into a frown, her nose twitching. “I can’t place her as a handmaiden now, but perhaps she will earn that position in time. We are in need of another scull.” My mother had told me that most servants working in the Great House started out as scullery maids, more often called sculls, although she had the great fortune of being selected as a handmaiden upon entrance to the Great House. Sculls had the unfortunate privilege of performing all of the dirty undignified chores disliked by the apprentices or masters in a given discipline, or the handmaidens and valets who served a single mistress or master.

Mistress Laurey was silent for a moment, before addressing me. “You will work for Mallory, the head kitchen maid. It’s a hard life, and it will be three years before you have an opportunity to advance your status here. If you leave your position, we’ll not take you back. Do you understand?”

“Yes, ma’am,” I whispered.

“What is your name?”

“Anais, ma’am.”

“Well, Anais,” Mistress Laurey said with a tight smile. “Welcome to the service of Lord and Lady Seve. You are very fortunate.”

Mistress Laurey turned back to Gil. “Her entrance fee is two silvers.”

Gil offered the coins with no protest, and then grinned at me before taking his leave. I felt cold. Without him, I was alone. I gulped and hoped I would at least be able to see him from time to time in the market. I rocked back and forth on my heels steadying my nervous stomach.

As Mistress Laurey led me through a long hall lit with floating candles, I couldn't help but wonder if a real mage lived in the Great House. I had never seen magic before. The truth was that I knew there weren’t any mages left, but I couldn’t force the hope out of my blood. Though I was curious, I didn't question Mistress Laurey about the candles or their origin. My lips felt as if they were frozen in place, and I was afraid to speak, afraid I would say something wrong. The hallway opened into a large airy kitchen. The last fading rays of sunlight filtered into the room through several small circular openings in the far wall, and three large fireplaces heating bronze pots and a large oven kept the room too warm.

“Mallory, we have a new scull. Please show her around, she will be one of yours,” Mistress Laurey said and then turned on her heels and left the room.

I was not alone with Mallory - perhaps fifteen others occupied the room, scrubbing, cooking, and talking. Mallory frowned at me, and sniffed haughtily. “You smell like fish guts, and you look like you’ve never bathed. Why do I always get the grubby ones?”

I reddened. I’d never considered it bad to smell like fish, but under this woman’s scrutiny, I couldn’t help but cringe. Mallory motioned to a girl who was scrubbing dishes, and whom I guessed was also a scull under her direction. “Addie, it’s your lucky day. Show fish girl your work. Once she’s trained, you can start working in the stables.”

A girl with sandy hair tied into two swinging braids, looked up. Her mouth curved into a grin. “Thanks Mal.”

“What’s your name?” Addie asked me.

“Anais.” I responded.

“Good to meet you.” She extended a red swollen hand, and I shook it gratefully. “Well, let’s get you started. Grab a rag.” She motioned to a large pile of dishrags on the stone floor.

I pulled one off the top, and sat on a stool beside the girl. We washed an almost endless succession of ceramic and bronze pots, iron pans, wooden dishes and long wooden spoons.

“Every evening you’ll wash dishes, not the important stuff mind you. Mallory or one of her apprentices usually cleans the silver and valuable china. You’ll be washing the servants’ dishes and all the cooking utensils.”

We continued to scrub dishes for several hours while the girl chatted about her family and her situation as the youngest of ten. Her brothers operated a small farm, but no place existed for her there. Most sculls in the Great House came from similar backgrounds, tradesmen’s or farmer’s children but not the ones slated to take over the family trade.

In a brief respite from the girl chatting, I gathered my courage and looked at her with wide eyes. “I saw the floating candles in the hallway. I thought magic was illegal in Brightshire.”

“Oh those. A long time ago, in the age of kings, King Sirmon banished a mage named Grayson, along with the queen, to Brightshire. The king’s court was a long way away. They say the queen was unable to bear King Sirmon a son, and so he ordered Grayson to accompany her into exile to prevent her from seeking aid from her family. At the time, our shire was little more than a trading post, a fitting exile for a disgraced queen. They say that after several years living here, Grayson fell in love with her and during that time they had the Great House built. Eventually they sought out her family’s support to overthrow King Sirmon, beginning the war, of course. Grayson was a powerful mage and left some residual magic in the house, not serious magic mind you, just the floating candles that always shine, and the bells that ring mysteriously every seventh day at sunset. I’ve also heard that there are still some spells in place that provide protection against invasion.”

“What happened to Grayson and the queen?”

“They won the war, dissolved the monarchy, set up the seven lords of the Seven Shires, and then just disappeared. No one knows what happened to them after that. I’m surprised you didn’t know that already.”

“How can there still be magic here without a mage?”

Addie shrugged. “I haven’t the faintest clue how that stuff works…”

“Have you ever been to Barriershire?” I asked.

“No, I’ve never been that far north. I’ve never had an opportunity to travel. Maybe once I’m working in the stables...”

“I saw a dwarf taking a boy to Barriershire. He said he was going to sell the boy.” I decided not to tell Addie that the boy might be a fury - I didn’t want to sound like a foolish child.

“Maybe the boy was a thief. Sometimes they sell thieves to the Arena master and make them fight. If that’s what happened, he’ll probably die. The regular arena fighters are pretty fierce. One of my brothers got caught stealing a few years back, and he was sold to the arena master in Barriershire. One fight and he was dead. My parents never got over it.”

“I’m sorry,” I said.

I looked down to see that the pile of dishes had diminished to nothing, and then looked back up into Addie’s eyes.

“Looks like we’re done here. C’mon, let’s get some sleep.” She smiled.

Standing, my knees creaked and I felt my arms go limp. I wondered how many hours there were left until daylight, it seemed like we had scrubbed dishes for forever. We were the last ones to leave, and Addie snuffed out the lone candle, leaving the room in inky darkness.

I scuttled after Addie into a small dank windowless room just outside of the kitchen. She lit a candle, and I noticed that she dragged her left leg a little as she walked. I couldn’t keep myself from staring.

“I know, I know. There was an accident when I was little. A horse stepped on my foot.”

“And you still want to work in the stables?”

“It wasn’t the horse’s fault.” She half grinned. “It was mine.”

The room held a set of bunk beds and Addie indicated that the one beneath her bed was for me. She then pointed to a pile of clothes in one corner where I found a brown cotton nightdress that billowed around my sleight form.

I closed my eyes and the face of the boy in the cage swam into my mind. He couldn’t have really been a fury. He was just a boy with horrible eyes. I should have tried to stop the dwarf. I should have attempted to free the boy. I could have at least told Gil. What if he died and I could have saved him? I groaned. Not a fury, not a fury, not a fury. I heard my mother singing, as I drifted off, “Dark at night, feel your fright, they creep and crawl, you cry and fall, you’ll never get away. Hide inside, my dearest child, or the furies will catch and eat you...”

The next morning came too quickly, and I woke with a headache. As the early morning wore on, Addie indoctrinated me into my new life, which started with scrubbing floors. Shortly after we started, another girl joined us.

“How was your day off?” Addie asked her.

“Lovely,” the girl twirled around in an awkward circle before settling her eyes on me. She wore a beige pinafore over a brown dress, identical to the clothes Addie and I wore.

“Who are you?” She asked in a sickly sweet voice.

“Her name’s Anais. Be nice, Kirsten. Please.”

“Oh, I’ll be nice. What does your family do?” Kirsten asked as she fiddled with a loose strand of dark red hair.

“Fishermen.”

“Really? How dreary, no wonder you smell so horrible.”

I sniffed at my hands. “I don’t smell bad.”

Kirsten sneered. “She can’t even tell. She’s probably always smelled like dead fish.”

“Leave her alone.” Addie sighed.

Kirsten smirked, before exiting the room in a swish of skirts.

After Addie and I had finished scrubbing the floors, we reported back to the kitchen.

“Got anything else for us?” Addie asked Mallory, who looked up from the silver she was polishing.

“Empty out the chamber pots and water basins in the east wing, third floor, after that you may take your break.” Mallory then stood and addressed two of her apprentices who were helping her. “Set the dining room table for breakfast.”

I followed Addie up a short flight of stone stairs. There were no pictures, ornaments or windows adorning the servant’s areas. I didn’t like the narrowness of the staircase and hallways.

“These are the servant’s stairs. Never take the main stairs; if you do and get caught there will be hell to pay. We may only go into the dining hall and entranceway to clean before breakfast, after breakfast you’ll be smart to stick to the servant’s areas. Mallory will skin you, or worse, if you are seen or heard by anyone of consequence.”

We walked through a winding hall to a long row of doors. I coughed. “There’s so much dust.”

Addie shrugged. “You’ll get used to it. Nobody cleans these halls.”

“Where are we?”

“East wing of the third floor. This area is for wealthy visiting tradesman, governesses, tutors, and artists, or anyone who is an independent citizen, living and working here. Right now, only four of the rooms are occupied, but you need to check all of the chambers. No one will tell you if someone new arrives. You just need to know.”

Addie paused at the first door. “Always knock first, just in case.”

She knocked and when no one answered, we entered. The room seemed huge, and was dominated by a dusty rose hue and decorated with large murals of women posing in intricate garden scenes.

“Blanche Howard lives in here; she’s Clara’s governess.”

“Clara?” I raised an eyebrow.

“Clara is Lord Seve’s daughter. You shouldn’t have trouble getting into Blanche’s room, because she starts her day with Clara very early.”

We checked her storage of candles, and Addie pulled two candles from a large satchel wrapped around her waist and added them to the pile. We cleaned the candleholders of the used wax. At Addie’s instruction, I swept up the excess char from the fireplace. The room held a smaller partition hidden by a heavy plum-colored velvet curtain. Addie opened the curtain to find a small white ceramic washbasin filled with sudsy water, and a copper chamber pot filled with urine.

Addie picked up the washbasin and indicated to me to pick up the chamber pot. We walked down the servant’s hall and stairs, and outside to a small stream and sewer line. She and I dumped the contents of the pot and basin into the sewer, and I scrubbed the chamber pot while she filled the basin halfway up with fresh water.

“Where does the sewer line go?” I wondered aloud.

“Don’t know.” Addie shrugged as we walked back to the house.

“How many sculls are there in the Great House?”

“Oh, about seven sculls report to Mallory. The guild price is low, so supply is high. There are usually more of us, but over the last few months two sculls disappeared. I don’t mean that they ran away, for that frequently happens. They vanished,” Addie confided. “When sculls run away, we know because they are spotted in town, but the two that disappeared, they haven’t been seen at all.”

“Do you know what happened to them?”

“No.” Addie shivered. “I’ll admit it has me nervous though.”

I inhaled sharply, remembering the boy in the market. She looked back at me as if wanting to ask me something. I changed the subject. “How long have you been here, working here I mean?” I asked.

“Mm, oh about two and a half years. Sculls are apprenticed off after three years, but I got lucky and am apprenticing a little early. Bertram, the master of the stables, just got in a shipment of Greys. Lord Seve wants to breed them, so it’s been crazy in the stables and they need an extra hand.”

“Does every scull get apprenticed after three years?”

“Most of us, I think. If you don’t get an apprenticeship after three years of service they ask you to leave.”

“Why?”

“I think it’s supposed to prevent sculls from, well, remaining sculls forever. It should be easy enough for you to get on the kitchen, laundry, or bath staff after you’ve completed your service. They always need people.”

“What about becoming a handmaiden?”

“Ambitious, are we?” Addie snorted, and then quickly looked apologetic. “It’s possible. Not easy, but possible. Kirsten says she is going to try for it next year, but I doubt she’ll make it. There are a few positions open in the household, but handmaidens are often poor relatives of someone important. And I don’t think Kirsten’s important, and I hate to say it, but I doubt you’re important either.”

My stomach dropped; this was going to be impossible. How had my mother ever believed that I would become a handmaiden? For that matter, how had my mother done it? I barely suppressed a moan.

“You okay?”

“Yeah. Sorry. I’m fine.”

We finished emptying the washbasins and chamber pots from the other occupied rooms, and in the second to last room we found four large locked trunks of dark brown leather. Other than the trunks, the room was bare.

“Those weren’t there yesterday,” Addie commented, her brow furrowing. After a moment, she shrugged it off.

The last room, a small room with yellow walls, was also empty.

“You hungry?” Addie asked.

“Starving,” I said, realizing that we hadn’t eaten a thing since waking up.

“Good, let’s go down to the kitchen. The remains from breakfast should be back from the dining hall. The best thing about being a scull is that we g"

A Princess of Mars,"CHAPTER I
On the Arizona Hills. I am a very old man; how old I do not know. Possibly I am a hundred, possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men, nor do I remember any childhood. So far as I can recollect I have always been a man, a man of about thirty. I appear today as I did forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection. I do not know why I should fear death, I who have died twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality. And because of this conviction I have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death. I cannot explain the phenomena; I can only set down here in the words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizona cave. I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate. Possibly the suggestions which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me. My name is John Carter; I am better known as Captain Jack Carter of Virginia. At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of several hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captain’s commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed; the servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South. Masterless, penniless, and with my only means of livelihood, fighting, gone, I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold. I spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate officer, Captain James K. Powell of Richmond. We were extremely fortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and privations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured. Powell, who was a mining engineer by education, stated that we had uncovered over a million dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months. As our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us must return to civilization, purchase the necessary machinery and return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine. As Powell was familiar with the country, as well as with the mechanical requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to make the trip. It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector. On March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our burros, and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse, and started down the mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first stage of his journey. The morning of Powell’s departure was, like nearly all Arizona mornings, clear and beautiful; I could see him and his little pack animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley, and all during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau. My last sight of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of the range on the opposite side of the valley. Some half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals. I am not given to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myself that all was well with Powell, and that the dots I had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses, the less I was able to assure myself. Since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian, and we had, therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont to ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails, taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches. Powell, I knew, was well armed and, further, an experienced Indian fighter; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in the North, and I knew that his chances were small against a party of cunning trailing Apaches. Finally I could endure the suspense no longer, and, arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine, I strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse, started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning. As soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a canter and continued this, where the going permitted, until, close upon dusk, I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell. They were the tracks of unshod ponies, three of them, and the ponies had been galloping. I followed rapidly until, darkness shutting down, I was forced to await the rising of the moon, and given an opportunity to speculate on the question of the wisdom of my chase. Possibly I had conjured up impossible dangers, like some nervous old housewife, and when I should catch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains. However, I am not prone to sensitiveness, and the following of a sense of duty, wherever it may lead, has always been a kind of fetich with me throughout my life; which may account for the honors bestowed upon me by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings, in whose service my sword has been red many a time. About nine o’clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast walk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about midnight, I reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp. I came upon the spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely deserted, with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp. I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen, for such I was now convinced they must be, continued after Powell with only a brief stop at the hole for water; and always at the same rate of speed as his. I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture, so I urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping against hope that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him. Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me. I knew that Powell would need me now if ever, and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and difficult mountain trail. I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds, when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small, open plateau near the summit of the pass. I had passed through a narrow, overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land, and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay. The little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees, and there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some object near the center of the camp. Their attention was so wholly riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me, and I easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and made my escape with perfect safety. The fact, however, that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me. I do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes, because, in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death, I cannot recall a single one where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many hours later. My mind is evidently so constituted that I am subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to tiresome mental processes. However that may be, I have never regretted that cowardice is not optional with me. In this instance I was, of course, positive that Powell was the center of attraction, but whether I thought or acted first I do not know, but within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of warriors, shooting rapidly, and whooping at the top of my lungs. Singlehanded, I could not have pursued better tactics, for the red men, convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars was upon them, turned and fled in every direction for their bows, arrows, and rifles. The view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with apprehension and with rage. Under the clear rays of the Arizona moon lay Powell, his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the braves. That he was already dead I could not but be convinced, and yet I would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apaches as quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death. Riding close to him I reached down from the saddle, and grasping his cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount. A backward glance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be more hazardous than to continue across the plateau, so, putting spurs to my poor beast, I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I could distinguish on the far side of the table land. The Indians had by this time discovered that I was alone and I was pursued with imprecations, arrows, and rifle balls. The fact that it is difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight, that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent, and that I was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various deadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows of the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized. My horse was traveling practically unguided as I knew that I had probably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass than he, and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the summit of the range and not to the pass which I had hoped would carry me to the valley and to safety. It is probable, however, that to this fact I owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which befell me during the following ten years. My first knowledge that I was on the wrong trail came when I heard the yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off to my left. I knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock formation at the edge of the plateau, to the right of which my horse had borne me and the body of Powell. I drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below and to my left, and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing around the point of a neighboring peak. I knew the Indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong trail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right direction as soon as they located my tracks. I had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff. The trail was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction I wished to go. The cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right, and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom of a rocky ravine. I had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn to the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave. The opening was about four feet in height and three to four feet wide, and at this opening the trail ended. It was now morning, and, with the customary lack of dawn which is a startling characteristic of Arizona, it had become daylight almost without warning. Dismounting, I laid Powell upon the ground, but the most painstaking examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life. I forced water from my canteen between his dead lips, bathed his face and rubbed his hands, working over him continuously for the better part of an hour in the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead. I was very fond of Powell; he was thoroughly a man in every respect; a polished southern gentleman; a staunch and true friend; and it was with a feeling of the deepest grief that I finally gave up my crude endeavors at resuscitation. Leaving Powell’s body where it lay on the ledge I crept into the cave to reconnoiter. I found a large chamber, possibly a hundred feet in diameter and thirty or forty feet in height; a smooth and well-worn floor, and many other evidences that the cave had, at some remote period, been inhabited. The back of the cave was so lost in dense shadow that I could not distinguish whether there were openings into other apartments or not. As I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasant drowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of my long and strenuous ride, and the reaction from the excitement of the fight and the pursuit. I felt comparatively safe in my present location as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave against an army. I soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong desire to throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments’ rest, but I knew that this would never do, as it would mean certain death at the hands of my red friends, who might be upon me at any moment. With an effort I started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenly against a side wall, and from there slip prone upon the floor.

CHAPTER II
The escape of the dead. A sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me, my muscles relaxed, and I was on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of approaching horses reached my ears. I attempted to spring to my feet but was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to my will. I was now thoroughly awake, but as unable to move a muscle as though turned to stone. It was then, for the first time, that I noticed a slight vapor filling the cave. It was extremely tenuous and only noticeable against the opening which led to daylight. There also came to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor, and I could only assume that I had been overcome by some poisonous gas, but why I should retain my mental faculties and yet be unable to move I could not fathom. I lay facing the opening of the cave and where I could see the short stretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliff around which the trail led. The noise of the approaching horses had ceased, and I judged the Indians were creeping stealthily upon me along the little ledge which led to my living tomb. I remember that I hoped they would make short work of me as I did not particularly relish the thought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spirit prompted them. I had not long to wait before a stealthy sound apprised me of their nearness, and then a war-bonneted, paint-streaked face was thrust cautiously around the shoulder of the cliff, and savage eyes looked into mine. That he could see me in the dim light of the cave I was sure for the early morning sun was falling full upon me through the opening. The fellow, instead of approaching, merely stood and stared; his eyes bulging and his jaw dropped. And then another savage face appeared, and a third and fourth and fifth, craning their necks over the shoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow ledge. Each face was the picture of awe and fear, but for what reason I did not know, nor did I learn until ten years later. That there were still other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from the fact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them. Suddenly a low but distinct moaning sound issued from the recesses of the cave behind me, and, as it reached the ears of the Indians, they turned and fled in terror, panic-stricken. So frantic were their efforts to escape from the unseen thing behind me that one of the braves was hurled headlong from the cliff to the rocks below. Their wild cries echoed in the canyon for a short time, and then all was still once more. The sound which had frightened them was not repeated, but it had been sufficient as it was to start me speculating on the possible horror which lurked in the shadows at my back. Fear is a relative term and so I can only measure my feelings at that time by what I had experienced in previous positions of danger and by those that I have passed through since; but I can say without shame that if the sensations I endured during the next few minutes were fear, then may God help the coward, for cowardice is of a surety its own punishment. To be held paralyzed, with one’s back toward some horrible and unknown danger from the very sound of which the ferocious Apache warriors turn in wild stampede, as a flock of sheep would madly flee from a pack of wolves, seems to me the last word in fearsome predicaments for a man who had ever been used to fighting for his life with all the energy of a powerful physique. Several times I thought I heard faint sounds behind me as of somebody moving cautiously, but eventually even these ceased, and I was left to the contemplation of my position without interruption. I could but vaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis, and my only hope lay in that it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me. Late in the afternoon my horse, which had been standing with dragging rein before the cave, started slowly down the trail, evidently in search of food and water, and I was left alone with my mysterious unknown companion and the dead body of my friend, which lay just within my range of vision upon the ledge where I had placed it in the early morning. From then until possibly midnight all was silence, the silence of the dead; then, suddenly, the awful moan of the morning broke upon my startled ears, and there came again from the black shadows the sound of a moving thing, and a faint rustling as of dead leaves. The shock to my already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme, and with a superhuman effort I strove to break my awful bonds. It was an effort of the mind, of the will, of the nerves; not muscular, for I could not move even so much as my little finger, but none the less mighty for all that. And then something gave, there was a momentary feeling of nausea, a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire, and I stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknown foe. And then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my own body as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground. I looked first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then down at myself in utter bewilderment; for there I lay clothed, and yet here I stood but naked as at the minute of my birth. The transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis. My first thought was, is this then death! Have I indeed passed over forever into that other life! But I could not well believe this, as I could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me. My breath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out from every pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed the fact that I was anything other than a wraith. Again was I suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave. Naked and unarmed as I was, I had no desire to face the unseen thing which menaced me. My revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which, for some unfathomable reason, I could not bring myself to touch. My carbine was in its boot, strapped to my saddle, and as my horse had wandered off I was left without means of defense. My only alternative seemed to lie in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the rustling sound from the thing which now seemed, in the darkness of the cave and to my distorted imagination, to be creeping stealthily upon me. Unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place I leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear Arizona night. The crisp, fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as an immediate tonic and I felt new life and new courage coursing through me. Pausing upon the brink of the ledge I upbraided myself for what now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension. I reasoned with myself that I had lain helpless for many hours within the cave, yet nothing had molested me, and my better judgment, when permitted the direction of clear and logical reasoning, convinced me that the noises I had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes; probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had caused the sounds I heard. I decided to investigate, but first I lifted my head to fill my lungs with the pure, invigorating night air of the mountains. As I did so I saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, and level, cacti-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment. Few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an Arizona moonlit landscape; the silvered mountains in the distance, the strange lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the grotesque details of the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and inspiring; as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of some dead and forgotten world, so different is it from the aspect of any other spot upon our earth. As I stood thus meditating, I turned my gaze from the landscape to the heavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for the wonders of the earthly scene. My attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant horizon. As I gazed upon it I felt a spell of overpowering fascination—it was Mars, the god of war, and for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power of irresistible enchantment. As I gazed at it on that far-gone night it seemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron. My longing was beyond the power of opposition; I closed my eyes, stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of space. There was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness."
Ardath,"CHAPTER I.



THE MONASTERY.



Deep in the heart of the Caucasus mountains a wild storm was gathering. Drear shadows drooped and thickened above the Pass of Dariel,—that terrific gorge which like a mere thread seems to hang between the toppling frost-bound heights above and the black abysmal depths below,—clouds, fringed ominously with lurid green and white, drifted heavily yet swiftly across the jagged peaks where, looming largely out of the mist, the snow-capped crest of Mount Kazbek rose coldly white against the darkness of the threatening sky. Night was approaching, though away to the west a road gash of crimson, a seeming wound in the breast of heaven, showed where the sun had set an hour since. Now and again the rising wind moaned sobbingly through the tall and spectral pines that, with knotted roots fast clenched in the reluctant earth, clung tenaciously to their stony vantageground; and mingling with its wailing murmur, there came a distant hoarse roaring as of tumbling torrents, while at far-off intervals could be heard the sweeping thud of an avalanche slipping from point to point on its disastrous downward way. Through the wreathing vapors the steep, bare sides of the near mountains were pallidly visible, their icy pinnacles, like uplifted daggers, piercing with sharp glitter the density of the low-hanging haze, from which large drops of moisture began presently to ooze rather than fall. Gradually the wind increased, and soon with sudden fierce gusts shook the pine-trees into shuddering anxiety,—the red slit in the sky closed, and a gleam of forked lightning leaped athwart the driving darkness. An appalling crash of thunder followed almost instantaneously, its deep boom vibrating in sullenly grand echoes on all sides of the Pass, and then—with a swirling, hissing rush of rain—the unbound hurricane burst forth alive and furious. On, on! splitting huge boughs and flinging them aside like straws, swelling the rivers into riotous floods that swept hither and thither, carrying with them masses of rock and stone and tons of loosened snow—on, on! with pitiless force and destructive haste, the tempest rolled, thundered, and shrieked its way through Dariel. As the night darkened and the clamor of the conflicting elements grew more sustained and violent, a sudden sweet sound floated softly through the turbulent air—the slow, measured tolling of a bell. To and fro, to and fro, the silvery chime swung with mild distinctness—it was the vesper-bell ringing in the Monastery of Lars far up among the crags crowning the ravine.

There the wind roared and blustered its loudest; it whirled round and round the quaint castellated building, battering the gates and moving their heavy iron hinges to a most dolorous groaning; it flung rattling hailstones at the narrow windows, and raged and howled at every corner and through every crevice; while snaky twists of lightning played threateningly over the tall iron Cross that surmounted the roof, as though bent on striking it down and splitting open the firm old walls it guarded. All was war and tumult without:—but within, a tranquil peace prevailed, enhanced by the grave murmur of organ music; men’s voices mingling together in mellow unison chanted the Magnificat, and the uplifted steady harmony of the grand old anthem rose triumphantly above the noise of the storm. The monks who inhabited this mountain eyrie, once a fortress, now a religious refuge, were assembled in their little chapel—a sort of grotto roughly hewn out of the natural rock.

Fifteen in number, they stood in rows of three abreast, their white woollen robes touching the ground, their white cowls thrown back, and their dark faces and flashing eyes turned devoutly toward the altar whereon blazed in strange and solitary brilliancy a Cross of Fire. At the first glance it was easy to see that they were a peculiar Community devoted to some peculiar form of worship, for their costume was totally different in character and detail from any such as are worn by the various religious fraternities of the Greek, Roman, or Armenian faith, and one especial feature of their outward appearance served as a distinctly marked sign of their severance from all known monastic orders—this was the absence of the disfiguring tonsure. They were all fine-looking men seemingly in the prime of life, and they intoned the Magnificat not drowsily or droningly, but with a rich tunefulness and warmth of utterance that stirred to a faint surprise and contempt the jaded spirit of one reluctant listener present among them. This was a stranger who had arrived that evening at the monastery, and who intended remaining there for the night—a man of distinguished and somewhat haughty bearing, with a dark, sorrowful, poetic face, chiefly remarkable for its mingled expression of dreamy ardor and cold scorn, an expression such as the unknown sculptor of Hadrian’s era caught and fixed in the marble of his ivy-crowned Bacchus-Antinous, whose half-sweet, half-cruel smile suggests a perpetual doubt of all things and all men. He was clad in the rough-and-ready garb of the travelling Englishman, and his athletic figure in its plain-cut modern attire looked curiously out of place in that mysterious grotto which, with its rocky walls and flaming symbol of salvation, seem suited only to the picturesque prophet-like forms of the white-gowned brethren whom he now surveyed, as he stood behind their ranks, with a gleam of something like mockery in his proud, weary eyes.



“What sort of fellows are these?” he mused—“fools or knaves? They must be one or the other,—else they would not thus chant praises to a Deity of whose existence there is, and can be, no proof. It is either sheer ignorance or hypocrisy,—or both combined. I can pardon ignorance, but not hypocrisy; for however dreary the results of Truth, yet Truth alone prevails; its killing bolt destroys the illusive beauty of the Universe, but what then? Is it not better so than that the Universe should continue to seem beautiful only through the medium of a lie?”



His straight brows drew together in a puzzled, frowning line as he asked himself this question, and he moved restlessly. He was becoming impatient; the chanting of the monks grew monotonous to his ears; the lighted cross on the altar dazzled him with its glare. Moreover he disliked all forms of religious service, though as a lover of classic lore it is probable he would have witnessed a celebration in honor of Apollo or Diana with the liveliest interest. But the very name of Christianity was obnoxious to him.

Like Shelley, he considered that creed a vulgar and barbarous superstition. Like Shelley, he inquired, “If God has spoken, why is the world not convinced?” He began to wish he had never set foot inside this abode of what he deemed a pretended sanctity, although as a matter of fact he had a special purpose of his own in visiting the place-a purpose so utterly at variance with the professed tenets of his present life and character that the mere thought of it secretly irritated him, even while he was determined to accomplish it. As yet he had only made acquaintance with two of the monks, courteous, good-humored personages, who had received him on his arrival with the customary hospitality which it was the rule of the monastery to afford to all belated wayfarers journeying across the perilous Pass of Dariel. They had asked him no questions as to his name or nation, they had simply seen in him a stranger overtaken by the storm and in need of shelter, and had entertained him accordingly. They had conducted him to the refectory, where a well-piled log fire was cheerfully blazing, and there had set before him an excellent supper, flavored with equally excellent wine. He had, however, scarcely begun to converse with them when the vesper-bell had rung, and, obedient to its summons, they had hurried away, leaving him to enjoy his repast in solitude. When he had finished it, he had sat for a while dreamily listening to the solemn strains of the organ, which penetrated to every part of the building, and then moved by a vague curiosity to see how many men there were dwelling thus together in this lonely retreat, perched like an eagle’s nest among the frozen heights of Caucasus, he had managed to find his way, guided by the sound of the music, through various long corridors and narrow twisting passages, into the cavernous grot where he now stood, feeling infinitely bored and listlessly dissatisfied. His primary object in entering the chapel had been to get a good full view of the monks, and of their faces especially,—but at present this was impossible, as from the position he was obliged to occupy behind them their backs alone were visible.



“And who knows,” he thought moodily, “how long they will go on intoning their dreary Latin doggerel? Priestcraft and Sham!

There’s no escape from it anywhere, not even in the wilds of Caucasus! I wonder if the man I seek is really here, or whether after all I have been misled? There are so many contradictory stories told about him that one doesn’t know what to believe. It seems incredible that he should be a monk; it is such an altogether foolish ending to an intellectual career. For whatever may be the form of faith professed by this particular fraternity, the absurdity of the whole system of religion remains the same.

Religion’s day is done; the very sense of worship is a mere coward instinct—a relic of barbarism which is being gradually eradicated from our natures by the progress of civilization. The world knows by this time that creation is an empty jest; we are all beginning to understand its bathos! And if we must grant that there is some mischievous supreme Farceur who, safely shrouded in invisibility, continues to perpetrate so poor and purposeless a joke for his own amusement and our torture, we need not, for that matter, admire his wit or flatter his ingenuity! For life is nothing but vexation and suffering; are we dogs that we should lick the hand that crushes us?”



At that moment, the chanting suddenly ceased. The organ went on, as though musically meditating to itself in minor cords, through which soft upper notes, like touches of light on a dark landscape, flickered ripplingly,—one monk separated himself from the clustered group, and stepping slowly up to the altar, confronted the rest of his brethren. The fiery Cross shone radiantly behind him, its beams seeming to gather in a lustrous halo round his tall, majestic figure,—his countenance, fully illumined and clearly visible, was one never to be forgotten for the striking force, sweetness, and dignity expressed in its every feature. The veriest scoffer that ever made mock of fine beliefs and fair virtues must have been momentarily awed and silenced in the presence of such a man as this,—a man upon whom the grace of a perfect life seemed to have fallen like a royal robe, investing even his outward appearance with spiritual authority and grandeur.

At sight of him, the stranger’s indifferent air rapidly changed to one of eager interest,—leaning forward, he regarded him intently with a look of mingled astonishment and unwilling admiration,—the monk meanwhile extended his hands as though in blessing and spoke aloud, his Latin words echoing through the rocky temple with the measured utterance of poetical rhythm. Translated they ran thus: “Glory to God, the Most High, the Supreme and Eternal!”



And with one harmonious murmur of accord the brethren responded: “GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER! AMEN!”



“Glory to God, the Ruler of Spirits and Master of Angels!”



“GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER! AMEN!”



“Glory to God who in love never wearies of loving!”



“GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER! AMEN!”



“Glory to God in the Name of His Christ our Redeemer!”



“GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER! AMEN!”



“Glory to God for the joys of the Past, the Present and Future!”



“GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER! AMEN!”



“Glory to God for the Power of Will and the working of Wisdom!”



“GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER! AMEN!”



“Glory to God for the briefness of life, the gladness of death, and the promised Immortal Hereafter!”



“GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER! AMEN!”



Then came a pause, during which the thunder outside added a tumultuous Gloria of its own to those already recited,—the organ music died away into silence, and the monk now turning so that he faced the altar, sank reverently on his knees. All present followed his example, with the exception of the stranger, who, as if in deliberate defiance, drew himself resolutely up to his full height, and, folding his arms, gazed at the scene before him with a perfectly unmoved demeanor,—he expected to hear some long prayer, but none came. There was an absolute stillness, unbroken save by the rattle of the rain-drops against the high oriel window, and the whistling rush of the wind. And as he looked, the fiery Cross began to grow dim and pale,—little by little, its scintillating lustre decreased, till at last it disappeared altogether, leaving no trace of its former brilliancy but a small bright flame that gradually took the shape of a seven-pointed Star which sparkled through the gloom like a suspended ruby. The chapel was left almost in complete darkness—he could scarcely discern even the white figures of the kneeling worshippers,—a haunting sense of the Supernatural seemed to permeate that deep hush and dense shadow,—and notwithstanding his habitual tendency to despise all religious ceremonies, there was something novel and strange about this one which exercised a peculiar influence upon his imagination. A sudden odd fancy possessed him that there were others present besides himself and the brethren,—but who these “others” were, he could not determine. It was an altogether uncanny, uncomfortable impression—yet it was very strong upon him—and he breathed a sigh of intense relief when he heard the soft melody of the organ once more, and saw the oaken doors of the grotto swing wide open to admit a flood of cheerful light from the outer passage. The vespers were over,—the monks rose and paced forth two by two, not with bent heads and downcast eyes as though affecting an abased humility, but with the free and stately bearing of kings returning from some high conquest. Drawing a little further back into his retired corner, he watched them pass, and was forced to admit to himself that he had seldom or never seen finer types of splendid, healthful, and vigorous manhood at its best and brightest. As noble specimens of the human race alone they were well worth looking at,—they might have been warriors, princes, emperors, he thought—anything but monks. Yet monks they were, and followers of that Christian creed he so specially condemned,—for each one wore on his breast a massive golden crucifix, hung to a chain and fastened with a jewelled star.



“Cross and Star!” he mused, as he noticed this brilliant and singular decoration, “an emblem of the fraternity, I suppose, meaning … what? Salvation and Immortality? Alas, they are poor, witless builders on shifting sand if they place any hope or reliance on those two empty words, signifying nothing! Do they, can they honestly believe in God, I wonder? or are they only acting the usual worn-out comedy of a feigned faith?”



And he eyed them somewhat wistfully as their white apparelled figures went by—ten had already left the chapel. Two more passed, then other two, and last of all came one alone—one who walked slowly, with a dreamy, meditative air, as though he were deeply absorbed in thought. The light from the open door streamed fully upon him as he advanced—it was the monk who had recited the Seven Glorias. The stranger no sooner beheld him than he instantly stepped forward and touched him on the arm.



“Pardon!” he said hastily in English, “I think I am not mistaken—

your name is, or used to be Heliobas?”



The monk bent his handsome head in a slight yet graceful salutation, and smiled.



“I have not changed it,” he replied, “I am Heliobas still.” And his keen, steadfast, blue eyes rested half inquiringly, half compassionately, on the dark, weary, troubled face of his questioner who, avoiding his direct gaze, continued: “I should like to speak to you in private. Can I do so now—tonight—at once?”



“By all means!” assented the monk, showing no surprise at the request. “Follow me to the library, we shall be quite alone there.”



He led the way immediately out of the chapel, and through a stone-paved vestibule, where they were met by the two brethren who had first received and entertained the unknown guest, and who, not finding him in the refectory where they had left him, were now coming in search of him. On seeing in whose company he was, however, they drew aside with a deep and reverential obeisance to the personage called Heliobas—he, silently acknowledging it, passed on, closely attended by the stranger, till he reached a spacious, well-lighted apartment, the walls of which were entirely lined with books. Here, entering and closing the door, he turned and confronted his visitor—his tall, imposing figure in its trailing white garments calling to mind the picture of some saint or evangelist—and with grave yet kindly courtesy, said: “Now, my friend, I am at your disposal! In what way can Heliobas, who is dead to the world, serve one for whom surely as yet the world is everything?”



CHAPTER II.



CONFESSION.



His question was not very promptly answered. The stranger stood still, regarding him intently for two of three minutes with a look of peculiar pensiveness and abstraction, the heavy double fringe of his long dark lashes giving an almost drowsy pathos to his proud and earnest eyes. Soon, however, this absorbed expression changed to one of sombre scorn.



“The world!” he said slowly and bitterly. “You think I care for the world? Then you read me wrongly at the very outset of our interview, and your once reputed skill as a Seer goes for naught!

To me the world is a graveyard full of dead, worm-eaten things, and its supposititious Creator, whom you have so be praised in your orisons tonight, is the Sexton who entombs, and the Ghoul who devours his own hapless Creation! I myself am one of the tortured and dying, and I have sought you simply that you may trick me into a brief oblivion of my doom, and mock me with the mirage of a life that is not and can never be! How can you serve me? Give me a few hours’ respite from wretchedness! that is all I ask!”



As he spoke his face grew blanched and haggard, as though he suffered from some painfully repressed inward agony. The monk Heliobas heard him with an air of attentive patience, but said nothing; he therefore, after waiting for a reply and receiving none, went on in colder and more even tones: “I dare say my words seem strange to you—though they should not do so if, as reported, you have studied all the varying phases of that purely intellectual despair which, in this age of excessive over-culture, crushes men who learn too much and think too deeply.

But before going further I had better introduce myself. My name is Alwyn …”



“Theos Alwyn, the English author, I presume?” interposed the monk interrogatively.



“Why, yes!” this in accents of extreme surprise—“how did you know that!”



“Your celebrity,” politely suggested Heliobas, with a wave of the hand and an enigmatical smile that might have meant anything or nothing.



Alwyn colored a little. “Your mistake,” he said indifferently, “I have no celebrity. The celebrities of my country are few, and among them those most admired are jockeys and divorced women. I merely follow in the rear-line of the art or profession of literature—I am that always unluckiest and most undesirable kind of an author, a writer of verse—I lay no claim, not now at any rate, to the title of poet. While recently staying in Paris I chanced to hear of you …”



The monk bowed ever so slightly—there was a dawning gleam of satire in his brilliant eyes.



“You won special distinction and renown there, I believe, before you adopted this monastic life?” pursued Alwyn, glancing at him curiously.



“Did I?” and Heliobas looked cheerfully interested. “Really I was not aware of it, I assure you! Possibly my ways and doings may have occasionally furnished the Parisians with something to talk about instead of the weather, and I know I made some few friends and an astonishing number of enemies, if that is what you mean by distinction and renown!”



Alwyn smiled—his smile was always reluctant, and had in it more of sadness than sweetness, yet it gave his features a singular softness and beauty, just as a ray of sunlight falling on a dark picture will brighten the tints into a momentary warmth of seeming life.



“All reputation means that, I think,” he said, “unless it be mediocre—then one is safe; one has scores of friends, and scarce a foe. Mediocrity succeeds wonderfully well nowadays—nobody hates it, because every one feels how easily they themselves can attain to it. Exceptional talent is aggressive—actual genius is offensive; people are insulted to have a thing held up for their admiration which is entirely out of their reach. They become like bears climbing a greased pole; they see a great name above them—a tempting sugary morsel which they would fain snatch and devour—

and when their uncouth efforts fail, they huddle together on the ground beneath, look up with dull, peering eyes, and impotently snarl! But you,”—and here his gazed rested doubtfully, yet questioningly, on his companion’s open, serene countenance—‘you, if rumor speaks truly, should have been able to tame YOUR bears and turn them into dogs, humble and couchant! Your marvellous achievements as a mesmerist—”



“Excuse me!” returned Heliobas quietly, “I never was a mesmerist.”



“Well-as a spiritualist then; though I cannot admit the existence of any such thing as spiritualism.”



“Neither can I,” returned Heliobas, with perfect good-humor, “according to the generally accepted meaning of the term. Pray go on, Mr. Alwyn!”



Alwyn looked at him, a little puzzled and uncertain how to proceed. A curious sense of irritation was growing up in his mind against this monk with the grand head and flashing eyes—eyes that seemed to strip bare his innermost thoughts, as lightning strips bark from a tree.



“I was told,” he continued after a pause, during which he had apparently considered and prepared his words, “that you were chiefly known in Paris as being the possessor of some mysterious internal force—call it magnetic, hypnotic, or spiritual, as you please—which, though perfectly inexplicable, was yet plainly manifested and evident to all who placed themselves under your influence. Moreover, that by this force you were able to deal scientifically and practically with the active principle of intelligence in man, to such an extent that you could, in some miraculous way, disentangle the knots of toil and perplexity in an over-taxed brain, and restore to it its pristine vitality and vigor. Is this true? If so, exert your power upon me,—for something, I know not what, has of late frozen up the once overflowing fountain of my thoughts, and I have lost all working ability. When a man can no longer work, it were best he should die, only unfortunately I cannot die unless I kill myself,—which it is possible I may do ere long. But in the meantime,”—he hesitated a moment, then went on, “in the meantime, I have a strong wish to be deluded—I use the word advisedly, and repeat it—DELUDED into an imaginary happiness, though I am aware that as an agnostic and searcher after truth—truth absolute, truth positive—such a desire on my part seems even to myself inconsistent and unreasonable. Still I confess to having it; and therein, I know, I betray the weakness of my nature. It may be that I am tired “—and he passed his hand across his brow with a troubled gesture—“or puzzled by the infinite, incurable distress of all living things. Perhaps I am growing mad!—who knows!—but whatever my condition, you,—if report be correct,—have the magic skill to ravish the mind away from its troubles and transport it to a radiant Elysium of sweet illusions and ethereal ecstasies. Do this for me, as you have done it for others, and whatever payment you demand, whether in gold or gratitude, shall be yours.”



He ceased; the wind howled furiously outside, flinging gusty dashes of rain against the one window of the room, a tall arched casement that clattered noisily with every blow inflicted upon it by the storm. Heliobas gave him a swift, searching glance, half pitying, half disdainful.



“Haschisch or opium should serve your turn,” he said curtly. “I know of no other means whereby to temporarily still the clamorings of conscience.”



Alwyn flushed darkly. “Conscience!” he began in rather a resentful tone,



“Aye, conscience!” repeated Heliobas firmly. “There is such a thing. Do you profess to be wholly without it?”



Alwyn deigned no reply—the ironical bluntness of the question annoyed him.



“You have formed a very unjust opinion of me, Mr. Alwyn,”

continued Heliobas, “an opinion which neither honors your courtesy nor your intellect—pardon me for saying so. You ask me to ‘mock’

and ‘delude’ you as if it were my custom and delight to make dupes of my suffering fellow-creatures! You come to me as though I were a mesmerist or magnetizer such as you can hire for a few guineas in any civilized city in Europe—nay, I doubt not but that you consider me that kind of so-called ‘spiritualist’ whose enlightened intelligence and heaven-aspiring aims are demonstrated in the turning of tables and general furniture-gyration. I am, however, hopelessly deficient in such knowledge. I should make a most unsatisfactory conjurer! Moreover, whatever you may have heard concerning me in Paris, you must remember I am in Paris no longer. I am a monk, as you see, devoted to my vocation; I am completely severed from the world, and my duties and occupations in the present are widely different to those which employed me in the past. Then I gave what aid I could to those who honestly needed it and sought it without prejudice or personal distrust; but now my work among men is finished, and I practice my science, such as it is, on others no more, except in very rare and special cases.”



Alwyn heard, and the lines of his face hardened into an expression of frigid hauteur.



“I suppose I am to understand by this that you will do nothing for me?” he said stiffly.



“Why, what CAN I do?” returned Heliobas, smiling a little. “All you want—so you say—is a brief forgetfulness of your troubles.

Well, that is easily obtainable through certain narcotics, if you choose to employ them and take the risk of their injurious action on your bodily system. You can drug your brain and thereby fill it with drowsy suggestions of ideas—of course they would only he SUGGESTIONS, and very vague and indefinite ones too, still they might be pleasant enough to absorb and repress bitter memories for a time. As for me, my poor skill would scarcely avail you, as I could promise you neither self-oblivion nor visionary joy. I have a certain internal force, it is true—a spiritual force which when strongly exercised overpowers and subdues the material—and by exerting this I could, if I thought it well to do so, release your SOUL—that is, the Inner Intelligent Spirit which is the actual You—from its house of clay, and allow it an interval of freedom.

But what its experience might be in that unfettered condition, whether glad or sorrowful, I am totally unable to predict.”



Alwyn looked at him steadfastly.



“You believe in the Soul?” he asked.



“Most certainly!”



“As a separate Personality that continues to live on when the body perishes?”



“Assuredly.”



“And you profess to be able to liberate it for a time from its mortal habitation—”



“I do not profess,” interposed Heliobas quietly. “I CAN do so.”



“But with the success of the experiment your power ceases?—you cannot foretell whether the unimprisoned creature will take its course to an inferno of suffering or a heaven of delight?—is this what you mean?”



Heliobas bent his head in grave assent.



Alwyn broke into a harsh laugh—“Come then!” he exclaimed with a reckless air,—“Begin your incantations at once! Send me hence, no matter where, so long as I am for a while escaped from this den of a world, this dungeon with one small window through which, with the death rattle in our throats, we stare vacantly at the blank unmeaning honor of the Universe! Prove to me that the Soul exists —ye gods! Prove it! and if mine can find its way straight to the mainspring of this revolving Creation, it shall cling to the accused wheels and stop them, that they may grind out the tortures of Life no more!”



He flung up his hand with a wild gesture: his countenance, darkly threatening and defiant, was yet beautiful with the evil beauty of a rebellious and fallen angel. His breath came and went quickly,—

he seemed to challenge some invisible opponent. Heliobas meanwhile watched him much as a physician might watch in his patient the workings of a new disease, then he said in purposely cold and tranquil tones:



“A bold idea! singularly blasphemous, arrogant, and—fortunately for us all—impracticable! Allow me to remark that you are overexcited, Mr. Alwyn; you talk as madmen may, but as reasonable men should not. Come,” and he smiled,—a smile that was both grave and sweet, “come and sit down—you are worn out with the force of your own desperate emotions—rest a few minutes and recover your self.”



His voice thouqh gentle was distinctly authoritative, and Alwyn meeting the full gaze of his calm eyes felt bound to obey the implied command. He therefore sank listlessly into an easy chair near the table, pushing back the short, thick curls from his brow with a wearied movement; he was very pale,—an uneasy sense of shame was upon him, and he sighed,—a quick sigh of exhausted passion. Heliobas seated himself opposite and looked at him earnestly, he studied with sympathetic attention the lines of dejection and fatigue which marred the attractiveness of features otherwise frank, poetic, and noble. He had seen many such men. Men in their prime who had begun life full of high faith, hope, and lofty aspiration, yet whose fair ideals once bruised in the mortar of modern atheistical opinion had perished forever, while they themselves, like golden eagles suddenly and cruelly shot while flying in mid-air, had fallen helplessly, broken-winged among the dust-heaps of the world, never to rise and soar sunwards again.

Thinking this, his accents were touched with a certain compassion when after a pause he said softly:



“Poor boy!—poor, puzzled, tired brain that would fain judge Infinity by merely finite perception! You were a far truer poet, Theos Alwyn, when as a world-foolish, heaven-inspired lad you believed in God, and therefore, in godlike gladness, found all things good!”



Alwyn looked up—his lips quivered.



“Poet—poet!” he murmured—“why taunt me with the name?” He started upright in his chair—“Let me tell you all,” he said suddenly; “you may as well know what has made me the useless wreck I am; though perhaps I shall only weary you.”



“Far from it,” answered Heliobas gently. “Speak freely—but remember I do not compel your confidence.”



“On the contrary, I think you do!” and again that faint, half-mournful smile shone for an instant in his deep, dark eyes, “though you may not be conscious of it. Anyhow I feel impelled to unburden my heart to you: I have kept silence so long! You know what it is in the world, … one must always keep silence, always shut in one’s grief and force a smile, in company with the rest of the tormented, forced-smiling crowd. We can never be ourselves—

our veritable selves—for, if we were, the air would resound with our ceaseless lamentations! It is HORRIBLE to think of all the pent-up sufferings of humanity—all the inconceivably hideous agonies that remain forever dumb and unrevealed! When I was young,—how long ago that seems! yes, though my actual years are taut thirty, I feel an alder-elde of accumulated centuries upon me—when I was young, the dream of my life was Poesy. Perhaps I inherited the fatal love of it from my mother—she was a Greek-and she had a subtle music in her that nothing could quell, not even my father’s English coldness. She named me Theos, little guessing what a dreary sarcasm that name would prove! It was well, I think, that she died early.”



“Well for her, but perhaps not so well for you,” said Heliobas with a keen, kindly glance at him.



Alwyn sighed. “Nay, well, for us both,—for I should have c"

Heart of Darkness,"The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of
the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly
calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come
to and wait for the turn of the tide.

The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of
an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded
together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails
of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A
haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.
The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed
condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,
and the greatest, town on earth.

The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four
affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness
personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.

Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of
the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's
yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had,
because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a
box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow
sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had
sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,
and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an
idol. The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way
aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing
but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and
exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a
speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the
Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded
rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the
gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more somber
every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.

And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and
from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat,
as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that
gloom brooding over a crowd of men.

Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less
brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested
unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the
race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a
waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the
venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and
departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And
indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,
""followed the sea"" with reverence and affection, than to evoke the
great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal
current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories
of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles
of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is
proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled
and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the
ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from
the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be
visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale,
to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests--and that never
returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from
Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;
kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the
dark ""interlopers"" of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned ""generals""
of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all
had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,
messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the
sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river
into the mystery of an unknown earth! . . . The dreams of men, the seed
of commonwealths, the germs of empires.

The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear
along the shore. The Chapman lighthouse, a three-legged thing erect on a
mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a great
stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the upper
reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on
the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.

""And this also,"" said Marlow suddenly, ""has been one of the dark places
of the earth.""

He was the only man of us who still ""followed the sea."" The worst that
could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a
seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may
so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home
order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their
country--the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is
always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign
shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,
veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.
For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not
inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it
out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these
misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination
of moonshine.

His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow.
It was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and
presently he said, very slow--

""I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here,
nineteen hundred years ago--the other day. . . . Light came out of this
river since--you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on
a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the
flicker--may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling! But
darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of a commander of
a fine--what d'ye call 'em?--trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered
suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry; put in
charge of one of these craft the legionaries,--a wonderful lot of handy
men they must have been too--used to build, apparently by the hundred,
in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him here--the
very end of the world, a sea the color of lead, a sky the color of
smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina--and going up this
river with stores, or orders, or what you like. Sandbanks, marshes,
forests, savages,--precious little to eat fit for a civilized man,
nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine here, no going
ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like a
needle in a bundle of hay--cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and
death,--death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush. They must
have been dying like flies here. Oh yes--he did it. Did it very well,
too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except
afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps.
They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he was cheered
by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna
by-and-by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful
climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too
much dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some prefect, or
tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp,
march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the
utter savagery, had closed round him,--all that mysterious life of the
wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of
wild men. There's no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to
live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And
it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination
of the abomination--you know. Imagine the growing regrets, the longing
to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.""

He paused.

""Mind,"" he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the
hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the
pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a
lotus-flower--""Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves
us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not
much account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was
merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and
for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have
it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of
others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to
be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great
scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle
a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking
it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter
noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too
much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not
a sentimental pretense but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the
idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a
sacrifice to. . . .""

He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red
flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each
other--then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city
went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on,
waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till the end of
the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in
a hesitating voice, ""I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn
fresh-water sailor for a bit,"" that we knew we were fated, before
the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive
experiences.

""I don't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,""
he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales
who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to
hear; ""yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I
got out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I
first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the
culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of
light on everything about me--and into my thoughts. It was somber enough
too--and pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear either.
No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.

""I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of
Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--a regular dose of the East--six years
or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and
invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to
civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get
tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship--I should think the
hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn't even look at me. And I got
tired of that game too.

""Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for
hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all
the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on
the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map
(but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, 'When
I grow up I will go there.' The North Pole was one of these places, I
remember. Well, I haven't been there yet, and shall not try now. The
glamour's off. Other places were scattered about the Equator, and in
every sort of latitude all over the two hemispheres. I have been in some
of them, and . . . well, we won't talk about that. But there was one
yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to speak--that I had a hankering
after.

""True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled
since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be
a blank space of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream
gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it
one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map,
resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its
body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the
depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window,
it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I
remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.
Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can't trade without using some
kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn't I
try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not
shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.

""You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but
I have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because it's cheap
and not so nasty as it looks, they say.

""I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh
departure for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I
always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I
wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--I felt somehow
I must get there by hook or by crook. So I worried them. The men said
'My dear fellow,' and did nothing. Then--would you believe it?--I tried
the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.
Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear
enthusiastic soul. She wrote: 'It will be delightful. I am ready to do
anything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a
very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots
of influence with,' &c., &c. She was determined to make no end of fuss
to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.

""I got my appointment--of course; and I got it very quick. It appears
the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed
in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the
more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when I
made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the
original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes,
two black hens. Fresleven--that was the fellow's name, a Dane--thought
himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to
hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didn't surprise
me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that
Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two
legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out
there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the
need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he
whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people
watched him, thunderstruck, till some man,--I was told the chief's
son,--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab
with a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between
the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest,
expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand,
the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of
the engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much
about Fresleven's remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I
couldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to
meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough
to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not
been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped
black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity
had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had
scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had
never returned. What became of the hens I don't know either. I should
think the cause of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this
glorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope
for it.

Ella Eris and The Pirates of Redemption,"Chapter One


The sunlight trickled down through the leaves and branches of the trees, landing in spots and splotches on the leafy forest floor. A young girl sat in the subdued light with her back against a spreading oak, her eyes almost closed. A faint wind toyed with the folds of her dress, but beyond that she sat completely motionless.

She willed her racing heart to slow, measuring her breaths, filling her lungs as slowly as possible, exhaling so gently that her breath would not have disturbed a feather, she made herself as still and silent as a stone. The rough texture of the tree’s bark bit into her back, and the root filled ground beneath her felt lumpy and uncomfortable, but these things mattered little to her.

The only thing that mattered was the raven. It stood less than three feet away from her pecking at the seed she had scattered on the ground. She had visited this spot every day for a week now, and each day the bird ventured a little closer. She knew it was the same bird by the distinctive scar over its left eye. The thought flitted through her mind that the raven might be toying with her, that it knew what she intended all along, but was drawing out the process as long as possible for inscrutable reasons of its own. Yesterday it had come close enough for her to reach out and touch it before it exploded into flight, leaving behind a single slender black feather that drifted erratically to the ground in front of her.

The bird hopped a few inches closer. She dared not even move her eyes in their sockets fearful they might make some sound and frighten the bird into flight. The bird hopped again. So close. Ella dared to look down at her hand lying limp and still on the forest floor, the palm pointed upward filled with seed. The raven hopped forward again, cocked its head to one side, then tentatively pecked at the seed in her hand.

Her hand twitched upward with the speed of a striking snake and grabbed the bird around the neck. The terrified animal squawked and flailed its wings, trying to twist its head and catch one of her fingers in its snapping beak, but Ella held firm.

She closed her eyes and saw the bird through the eyes in her hand. The hand saw so much more clearly. It saw the bird soaring in the morning air, and felt the rush of wind through its feathers. It saw beyond the body of the raven and saw its Form. Black and majestic. Made for the skies. The Form. It filled her mind like water filling a hollow in the ground, seeping into every crack and crevice until her Form and the Form of the raven were one.

Then she opened her hand and released the bird. Its wings blurred into a flurry of black that lifted it into the air as it screeched back at her for the indignity it had suffered.

She watched until the bird was lost from sight, not knowing what to feel. She knew the step she was about to take could be dangerous. Her mother had warned her again and again. “People don’t understand, Ella,” she had said. “And they’re afraid of things they don’t understand. If people found out it could be…dangerous.”

And over the years Ella had respected her mother’s wishes. But in the past few months something had changed. She had always had the ability to Change, but now it was becoming something more, a desire, no, a need to use her talent that grew with each passing day. This is what I am, she thought. I can’t go through life hiding from it.

So she closed her eyes and focused on the Form of the bird. It was more than a shape. It was the essence of what the raven was. She opened her mind and let herself flow into it. It wasn’t something anyone had ever taught her. It couldn’t be taught, any more than a corpse could be taught to breathe, or a stone could learn to fly.

Ella opened her eyes and looked out through the eyes of the raven. The animal’s instincts meshed with her own thoughts as naturally as if she had been born in this body. She launched herself upwards, her wings beating hard against the air. She climbed through the porous canopy of leaves and branches and soared up into the sunlight. She flew higher and higher, far above the forest that grew up the side of the mountain. Below her the valley stretched out small and delicate, like a map brought to life. She saw wisps of smoke curling from the chimney of the blacksmith, and just up the road she saw Mr. Bartlett’s general store, an ugly brown building which always seemed to have everything they needed and nothing she wanted. And there on the outskirts of town stood the inn that she and her mother had called home for as long as she could remember. It had once seemed to her that the world could not extend far beyond the borders of the valley, but now she realized what a tiny piece of the world Caelum truly was. The mountains went on and on like a rumpled blanket made of earth and stone, and far beyond that she saw the beginnings of a great plain.

She felt nearly intoxicated by the experience but, she knew she couldn’t stay out too long without her mother suspecting the truth. But she couldn’t bring herself to come down, not now, not yet, not while the unseen parts of the world were calling to her. She turned on the breeze and let it carry her down the valley away from Caelum, following the road that cut through the valley, and led to the outside world. It looked small and inconsequential winding through the vast expanse of mountains.

When she was younger she had spent countless hours watching the road for travelers, but they were rare and never stayed for very long. During the winter when the mountain passes filled with snow, there were no travelers at all, but now the warmth of spring had melted the sparkling drifts into icy water that fed down into the rushing mountain streams. But even with the snow gone the passes could be dangerous. She had heard that in some places the road was barely navigable in the best conditions.

Ella had never ventured down the path that connected the tiny town to the outside world, but looking down from her elevated vantage point Ella could see that the road was as dangerous as she had heard. Barely a mile outside of town the path took a sharp turn high up on the side of the mountain. Ella glided closer to the treacherous turn amazed at the gaping chasm that yawned below the rough road.

Then something caught her eye. From this distance it was hard to see, but there was something at the bottom of the cliff, a shape that didn’t seem quite right. She glided in for a closer look, curious to find out what it was. Her curiosity turned to panic when she saw that the odd shape was the body of a man, crumpled and broken on the rocks. Ella flew faster now, beating her wings hard against the wind, pushing herself forward with every ounce of strength she had.

Even as she flew towards the body, part of her wanted to turn back. The man was almost certainly dead, and probably had been for some time.

Ella had only seen a dead body once before. When she was eight her mother had sent her to bring some supplies to an old man who lived like a hermit in a secluded stone cottage up the far side of the valley. It had been summer time and by the time Ella found the body the stench was overwhelming. She hadn’t stuck around for long, but the image of the old man sitting in his rocking chair, his eyes staring at nothing while flies swarmed over his pale skin had branded itself into her memory.

But as much as she wanted to turn back she knew she had to at least check, to be sure there was nothing she could do to help. And there was something else too - a kind of morbid curiosity lurking behind her other emotions, excited at the idea of seeing the touch of death again.

She swooped lower and lower until her flight brought her to the bottom of the cliff. Even before she changed back into herself she knew the man was dead. His limbs where twisted beneath him with angles in places that no joint existed and the ground beneath his head was stained with the rust brown of dried blood. Ella crept closer, swallowing the fear creeping up in her throat and reminding herself that there was nothing less dangerous than a dead body.

Then she noticed the man’s clothes for the first time. They were unlike anything she had ever seen before. The material, if it could be called that, was black. Ella had a black dress that she hardly ever wore because it was a bit too small for her now, but that kind of black was only pretending to be the black that the dead man’s clothes were made of. It was a magical color, as if someone had captured the essence of midnight and spun cloth from it. Ella reached out and brushed her fingers against it, to assure herself it was real, then quickly withdrew her hand horrified at having touched the corpse.

She sat there for a moment, not moving, barely breathing, just looking at the dead man. She knew he could not have been dead for very long. The body hadn’t started to stink yet, and only a smattering of flies flitted around the corpse, feasting on the clotted blood and clustering around the unblinking eyes, eyes that stared out at nothing, frozen in an eternal expression of terror. Ella looked up at the cliff above and imagined the fall, the sickening feeling of rushing air and the ground coming up beneath you.

Who are you? she thought, and how did you get here? The nearest town was more than twenty miles down the road, too far for anyone travel on foot in the dead of night.

Ella pushed the questions to the back of her mind. She couldn’t stay here much longer. She had already been gone for nearly an hour and the return trip would take several minutes at the least. Still, she couldn’t leave the body to rot and dry in the sun, exposed to the vultures and other scavengers that would pick the bones clean in a matter of weeks. She fought back her revulsion, grabbed the dead man by his cloak, and dragged the body against the cliff wall. Then she started to cover the mangled form with the loose rocks that littered the ground at the base of the cliff.

She was almost finished when she noticed that the dead man was clutching something in his hand. She looked closer and saw a small loop of silver chain emerging from between the fingers of the dead man’s fist. She tugged at it experimentally but the dead man’s grasp had tightened in death and she couldn’t budge the chain. Even as she pried the stiff cold fingers open she told herself that this was none of her business, that she should just leave it alone.

Then the chain fell to the ground with a musical tinkling sound, and Ella saw what the man had been clutching. It was a small black ring. She grasped the it between her fingers and held the it up to the light.

She was immediately struck by how heavy it felt, almost impossibly heavy for an object so small. As first she thought it might be made from obsidian or some strange black metal but she quickly realized that the ring was something far stranger. It hung in the air as black as a slice of pure darkness. If Ella had thought the man’s robes were black, then this was something different entirely. She reached out brushing the ring with her fingers and watched it swing back and forth. It was odd how the ring seemed not to reflect the light as if it were less than solid, less than real.

In the distance she heard the clop-clop of horse hooves coming up the path above her, and the groaning of a wagon’s wheels rolling along behind. Ella pressed herself against the cliff wall and waited for the sound to pass overhead. When it was silent again, she hurriedly worked to finish covering the body, the ring still hanging from the chain in her left hand.

She had to hurry back. She had already been gone too long. She looked at the ring again.

What are you doing Ella? she asked herself. It doesn’t belong to you.

It belongs to me as much as anybody, she countered. W_hy shouldn’t I take it?_

It looks dangerous. Leave it here.

But she didn’t. She slipped the chain over her head and tucked the ring into the collar of her dress. Again she was stuck by how heavy the thing seemed hanging there, pulling the chain so that the fine links bit into her neck.

She turned back to her task and continued piling stones over the body until she was sure it was safe from scavengers. When she had finished she looked down at the pile of rocks and bid a silent farewell to a man she had never known.





Chapter Two


Ella let her mind rest on the Form of the bird, and felt herself flow into it. She took off and flew as fast as she could.

Within fifteen minutes she touched down in the clearing, and changed back into herself. She sprinted down the path towards the town, slowing down only to wobble her way over the log that bridged the swollen brook. When she came in sight of the inn she slowed to a walk, and tried to affect an expression of nonchalance that she hoped would deflect any suspicions her mother might have. When she reached the inn she paused then opened the back door door and stepped into the dining hall. The room was empty, but that was hardly unusual.

She poked her head into the adjoining kitchen expecting to find her mother nursing a pot of stew, but was surprised to find that it was empty as well. Then she heard the sound of muffled voices and footsteps floating down from above her. She climbed the creaky wooden stairway up to the second floor of the inn where three thinly furnished rooms usually sat empty waiting for some rare traveler in need of shelter to occupy them. She found her mother in the hallway talking to a man Ella had never seen before.

“Oh there you are dear. I was just telling our guest that I was starting to wonder where you’d got to.”

“I must have lost track of time,” Ella replied, smiling in what she hoped was a disarming way. “The weather’s so beautiful this time of year.”

“Aye, the spring air in these mountains is as sweet as honey,” said the newcomer. “Somethin’ about things growing after the winter gives things a different feel. Like the whole world walkin’ with a spring in its step.”

“This is Julius, Ella,” her mother said. “He’ll be staying the night with us. Julius, this is my daughter Ella.”

Julius extended his hand and Ella shook it. He was a large man, but perhaps not big enough to be called fat. He had dark blue eyes, a nose several sizes too large for his face and a shiny bald head with a single wisp of white hair at the very top.

“Pleased to meet you Mr. Julius.”

Julius leaned down and whispered in her ear, but loud enough her mother to hear, “I’d prefer you skip the ‘mister’ part. Makes me feel old you know.”

Ella smiled, although in that moment she found herself trying to determine how old he really was with little success.

“Okay then. Julius. How long will you be staying here in Caelum?”

“I’m just passing through on my way to the coast. The next town is almost a whole day’s journey down the road, so I thought I’d stop here and save myself the trouble of bedding down under the stars.”

“It’s a good thing you did,” said Ella’s mother. “That road is dangerous even during the day and at nighttime it can be deadly.”

Ella caught herself nodding, thinking of the dead man. Her mother went on talking without taking notice.

“You’ll be sure to take extra care when you leave tomorrow Mr. Julius -Oh I’m sorry, I mean just Julius.”

“It’s okay ma’am,” Julius said. “I appreciate the concern. I’ll be sure and keep an eye out for trouble.”

“Well, come along Ella,” her mother said. “We should be getting lunch ready,” she turned back to Julius. “Will you be joining us?”

Julius grinned. “Never say no to food ma’am. I’ll be there.”

Ella followed her mother downstairs, where she spent the next few minutes helping her mother get things ready. The inn’s primary purpose was to provide a place for the people of the town to meet and eat. Although they did have rooms to accommodate travelers, they were rarely used, even in the spring and summer months. Caelum was a fairly obscure town, and most travelers followed the northern roads, which took the long way around the mountains but were far easier to navigate.

Ella’s thoughts wandered again to the dead man. He might have stayed at the inn if things had been different. She tried to imagine him as he might have been when he was alive. That face, smiling and laughing as he ate at the table. The image suddenly made his death seem more real and tragic, like she imagined death was supposed to feel. Her mother’s voice interrupted her reverie.

“What’s wrong dear? You look worried.”

Ella put on a smile and shook her head. “No I’m not worried. I guess I was just thinking.”

“Oh? About what?”

Ella paused then answered, “I was thinking about death.”

“Oh,” her mother said, looking a bit surprised. “Well that is serious. May I ask what could have brought on such a morbid train of thought?”

Ella shrugged. “I don’t know,” she lied.

“Thinking of anyone’s death in particular?”

“Not really. I guess it’s just a scary thought. That one day your life ends and there’s nothing left.”

“Well don’t let it bother you too much dear. Hopefully you won’t have to worry about it for a good long while.”

“Some of us will have to worry about starving to death if we don’t get some lunch soon,” said a gruff voice from the kitchen doorway.

Ella’s mother turned from her cooking to face the voice’s owner. “If you don’t have enough manners to know not to listen at my kitchen door, I have half a mind not to serve you Zebadiah.” The words were harsh, but the tone was not. Ella doubted her mother could ever be really angry with the man who had spoken. Even before she turned Ella had his face in her mind. It was an old face with more wrinkles than the mountains had valleys and it belonged to Zebadiah Jones.

“No harm meant, Miss Eris,” Zebadiah said quickly. “I was just hungry, and I s’pose my curiosity got the better of me.”

“Well go and sit down, and Ella will bring your food out directly,” said Ella’s mother.

Zebadiah nodded quickly and disappeared around the door. Ella knew without being told what the old man would have: a pot of stew and some water. Elle dished the stew into a bowl, and filled a wooden goblet with water. She brought them both out and put them in front of the old man.

“Thankee,” he said. “Thankee very much.”

Zebadiah dipped his spoon into the bowl of steaming stew and stuffed it into his mouth. “So what’s got yer mind thinking on the Specter Miss Ella?” he mumbled, his mouth opening slightly to reveal the half chewed food inside.

“The Specter?” Ella asked confused. “What’s that?”

Zebadiah washed down the mouthful of stew with a gulp of water and said, “You know. The Specter, the Ferryman, the Reaper of Souls. Death.”

Ella shook her head. “I don’t understand. You’re saying death is a person?”

“Well not a person as such. I guess its just superstition. Not much worth talking about really,” he said, taking another bite of stew.

But by now Ella was intrigued, and she wasn’t about to be put off that easily. “Tell me about it,” she insisted, sitting with her back to the table on the bench next to the old man.

And Zebadiah, whom Ella had never known to pass up the opportunity to tell a story, smiled and said, “Well if you insist. Though truly there’s not much to tell. Its more of an idea than anything else, the Specter is. A very old idea.”

“How old?”

“Older than anyone could ever know. As old as death I reckon. But the old ideas have power and this one goes a ways back. Back to the beginning maybe. You see, every living thing has a soul. It’s like the thing inside you that’s really you, that makes you alive. But the thing about the soul is that it don’t die when the body dies. It sort of hangs around with nothin’ to do. And that’s where the Specter comes in. The old legends say that he collects the souls of the dead and takes them far over the sea to the Island of the Dead.”

“And what happens then?” Ella asked.

Zebadiah shrugged. “Dunno. I reckon I’ll have to die to find out. I don’t s’pose it’ll be too much longer, for an old codger like me eh?” he said laughing.

“That’s not funny,” Ella said.

“No, maybe not. But it don’t do to worry too much about it before it happens. Besides Ella, none of us lives forever in this world and nothing’s gonna change that. Best do the most you can with the life you have.”

“Ella,” her mother’s called from the kitchen, “Can you come in here and peel these potatoes for me?.”

“Yes, ma’am. Coming,” Ella replied. She left Zebadiah with his stew and went back into the kitchen where a pile of potatoes sat on the table. Ella picked up a knife and started peeling the dry brown skin off the potatoes all the while thinking about what Zebadiah had said. Was it true? Was there really someone or something that came for you after you were dead? What happened after that? And then she thought of the old man’s words. “I reckon I’ll have to die to find out.”

She finished peeling the potatoes and gave them to her mother who was just pulling a loaf of bread out of the oven.

“Thank you, Ella. I think I heard our new guest come down. Would you go and see what he’d like to eat?”

Ella looked into the dining room and saw that Julius was there, sitting across the table from Zebadiah, talking with the old man as if he had known him for years.

“I didn’t know there was any kind of mining operation in these parts,” Julius was saying.

“Well, there was,” Zebadiah answered. “That’s how this town, if you can call it that, came to be out here in the middle of nowhere. Some old prospector discovered gold in these parts and next thing you know this lot sprang up.”

“And then?”

“Gold ran out,” Zebadiah explained. “And everyone left. Well most everyone anyway.”

“And the rest?”

Zebadiah shrugged. “There’s always a few folks that like to be away from civilization for one reason or another. I’m the only one still left that fools with the mine at all.”

“Ever find anything?”

“Oh, the odd nugget here and there. Mostly I just do it to keep myself occupied.”

“Excuse me,” Ella said, “I don’t mean to interrupt, but mother wanted me to find out what you wanted to eat Mr. Julius.”

” I’ll have some of that stew,” Julius said pointing to the wooden bowl in front of Zebadiah, “If there’s any left, that is.”

” I’m sure there is,” Ella said. The pot of stew was still warming on the stove, and Ella ladled it into another bowl and brought it out.

“Thank you Ella,” Julius said when she set it in front of him. “I hadn’t realized how hungry I was until I smelled that home cookin’.”

“Best chow for miles,” Zebadiah said.

“Care to join us Miss Ella?” Julius said.

Ella shrugged. “I guess I can.”. She went into the kitchen and poured a bowl of stew for herself, then joined Julius and Zebadiah at the table. When she returned, Zebadiah was asking Julius where he was from.

“Well I was born in Riparia,” Julius said, “but these days I don’t claim any land as my home. Most of my time is spent travelin’.”

” But what do you do?” Ella asked.

Julius shrugged. “Odds and ends,” he said. “At the moment I’m in the transport business. There’s always someone who needs somethin’ moved from here to there.”

” Sound’s interesting,” said Zebadiah.

” Can be,” Julius agreed, “but it can also be risky. There’s thieves, bandits, the odd goblin, here and there. Some of ‘em want your cargo and some just want trouble.”

” You’ve fought a goblin?” Zebadiah asked with an incredulous edge in his voice.

” Well to tell you the truth I ran away from him,” Julius admitted. “But I didn’t lose the load, my horses, or most importantly, my life.”

“What’s a goblin?” Ella asked.

“Nasty buggers,” Zebadiah said. “Green skin, sharp claws, lotsa teeth, and generally ugly as sin.”

“Seen one?” Julius asked.

“Only once, but that was plenty let me tell you.”

“Tell us about it,” Ella pleaded, but Zebadiah pushed back his chair and stood up.

“Not today lass. I’ve got to get back to the mine. At my age if I don’t keep movin’ my body might forget it’s not dead yet.”

Zebadiah said his goodbyes and shuffled out of the room. Just after he left Ella’s mother came in from the kitchen. “I trust my daughter isn’t boring you Mr. Julius,” she said.

“No, no, Mrs. Eris, not at all”

“It’s ‘Miss’,” Ella’s mother corrected.

“Oh, I beg your pardon ma’am.” Julius began to apologize, but Ella’s mother dismissed it with a wave of her hand, and a polite smile.

“It’s nothing to worry about,” she said. “Did you find the room to your liking?”

Ella picked up her empty bowl and left the two adults to their discussion. She knew how these conversations went. It amazed her how people could talk and not really say anything. She washed her bowl out in the kitchen and climbed to the inn’s attic. This was Ella’s territory, a world apart where she could look down on things from a disaffected vantage point. She had always loved the attic. It had a spacious feel to it though the slanting ceiling could make things seem cramped at times.

There were only a few pieces of simple furniture in the room. Her bed was pushed close to the slanting ceiling, and near the mouth of the stairs, a simple writing desk sat in front of the attic window that looked out over the town. At the far end of the room a simple wooden box which served as a wardrobe stood against the wall.

She shut the door behind her and sat down at her desk feeling excited and a little anxious. She reached for the chain around her neck, pulled it up over her head and stared at the ring dangling at the end. She paused for a moment then unclasped the chain and slipped the ring off into her palm. She turned it over and over in her fingers feeling the improbable weight of the thing. This was no ordinary ring. From the very moment she had seen it Ella had known that. Was it magic? Did it have something to do with how the man in black had died?

It must have been very important, Ella thought remembering how tightly the dead fingers had been clenched around the ring.

Yes, important, a second thought echoed back and probably dangerous too.

But what’s an adventure without danger?

The thought had been growing in Ella’s mind like a cloud changing in the sky. It could have been forming since she first saw the ring, or it might have only popped up in that instant, but once it had lodged in her mind there was no denying it. The ring was an adventure waiting to happen. She had to know where it would take her. For a moment she wavered, but only for a moment, and then, with trembling hands, she slipped the ring onto her finger."
Harry Potter - THE BOY WHO LIVED,"/ 




THE BOY WHO LIVED 

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, 
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, 
thank you very much. They were the last people you’d 
expect to be involved in anything strange or 
mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such 
nonsense. 

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called 
Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy 
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a 
very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and 
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of 
neck, which came in very useful as she spent so 
much of her time craning over garden fences, spying 
on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son 
called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer 
boy anywhere. 

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they 
also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that 
somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they 
could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. 
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 



met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended 
she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her 
good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it 
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think 
what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in 
the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a 
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. 

This boy was another good reason for keeping the 
Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a 
child like that. 

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray 
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the 
cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and 
mysterious things would soon be happening all over 
the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out 
his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley 
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming 
Dudley into his high chair. 

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past 
the window. 

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his 
briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and 
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because 
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his 
cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley 
as he left the house. He got into his car and backed 
out of number four’s drive. 

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the 
first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a 
map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he 
had seen — then he jerked his head around to look 
again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner 
of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What 
could he have been thinking of? It must have been a 
trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at 
Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around 
the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his 
mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet 
Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read 
maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake 
and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward 
town he thought of nothing except a large order of 
drills he was hoping to get that day. 

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his 
mind by something else. As he sat in the usual 
morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that 
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people 
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear 
people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups 
you saw on young people! He supposed this was some 
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the 
steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these 
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering 
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see 
that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that 
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an 
emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it 
struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly 
stunt — these people were obviously collecting for 
something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved 
on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the 
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. 

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in 
his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might 
have found it harder to concentrate on drills that 
morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in 
broad daylight, though people down in the street did; 
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after 
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an 
owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a 
perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five 
different people. He made several important telephone 
Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good 
mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch 
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a 
bun from the bakery. 

He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he 
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed 
them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but 
they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering 
excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting 
tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a 
large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words 
of what they were saying. 

“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” 

“ — yes, their son, Harry — ” 

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He 
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say 
something to them, but thought better of it. 

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his 
office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, 
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing 
his home number when he changed his mind. He put 
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, 
thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t 
such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots 
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. 
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew 
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It 
might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no 
point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so 
upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame 
her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the 
same, those people in cloaks ... 



Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that 
afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, 
he was still so worried that he walked straight into 
someone just outside the door. 

“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled 
and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. 
Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet 
cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost 
knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split 
into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that 
made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, 
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- 
Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like 
yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy 
day!” 

And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the 
middle and walked off. 

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been 
hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he 
had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was 
rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, 
hoping he was imagining things, which he had never 
hoped before, because he didn’t approve of 
imagination. 

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the 
first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — 
was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was 
now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the 
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. 

“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. 

The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. 

Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. 
Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the 

Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




house. He was still determined not to mention 
anything to his wife. 

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told 
him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems 
with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new 
word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. 
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the 
living room in time to catch the last report on the 
evening news: 

“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported 
that the nation’s owls have been behaving very 
unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at 
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have 
been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in 
every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to 
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their 
sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a 
grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim 
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more 
showers of owls tonight, Jim?” 

“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about 
that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting 
oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, 
and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that 
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a 
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have 
been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until 
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night 
tonight.” 

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars 
all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious 
people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a 
whisper about the Potters . . . 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two 
cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say 
something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er 
— Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister 
lately, have you?” 

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and 
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t 
have a sister. 

“No,” she said sharply. “Why?” 

“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. 
“Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of 
funny-looking people in town today ...” 

“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. 

“Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to 
do with ... you know ... her crowd.” 

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. 
Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d 
heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. 
Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — 
he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” 

“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. 

“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” 

“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” 

“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking 
horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” 

He didn’t say another word on the subject as they 
went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the 
bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window 

Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




and peered down into the front garden. The cat was 
still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though 
it were waiting for something. 

Was he imagining things? Could all this have 
anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out 
that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t 
think he could bear it. 

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep 
quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over 
in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell 
asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, 
there was no reason for them to come near him and 
Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and 
Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He 
couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up 
in anything that might be going on — he yawned and 
turned over — it couldn’t affect them. ... 

How very wrong he was. 

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy 
sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no 
sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, 
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet 
Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door 
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls 
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight 
before the cat moved at all. 

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been 
watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d 
have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The 
cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. 

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet 
Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the 
silver of his hair and beard, which were both long 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long 
robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and 
high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, 
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles 
and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it 
had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was 
Albus Dumbledore. 

Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had 
just arrived in a street where everything from his 
name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy 
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But 
he did seem to realize he was being watched, because 
he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still 
staring at him from the other end of the street. For 
some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse 
him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have 
known.” 

He found what he was looking for in his inside 
pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He 
flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. 
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He 
clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into 
darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, 
until the only lights left on the whole street were two 
tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of 
the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their 
window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they 
wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening 
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- 
Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the 
street toward number four, where he sat down on the 
wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a 
moment he spoke to it. 

“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”

He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. 
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking 
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the 
shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. 
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She 
looked distinctly ruffled. 

“How did you know it was me?” she asked. 

“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” 

“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all 
day,” said Professor McGonagall. 

“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I 
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my 
way here.” 

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 

“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said 
impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, 
but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s 
going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head 
back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I 
heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, 
they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to 
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll 
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much 
sense.” 

“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. 
“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven 
years.” 

“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. 

“But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are 
being downright careless, out on the streets in broad

daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, 
swapping rumors.” 

She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore 
here, as though hoping he was going to tell her 
something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine 
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who 
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found 
out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, 
Dumbledore?” 

“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have 
much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon 
drop?” 

“A what?” 

“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m 
rather fond of.” 

“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as 
though she didn’t think this was the moment for 
lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has 
gone — ” 

“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like 
yourself can call him by his name? All this You- 
Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been 
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper 
name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but 
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, 
seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we 
keep saying You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any 
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.” 

“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, 
sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re 
different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You- 
Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.” 

Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort 
had powers I will never have.” 



“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use 
them.” 

“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since 
Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” 

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at 
Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to 
the rumors that are flying around. You know what 
everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? 

About what finally stopped him?” 

It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the 
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real 
reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all 
day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she 
fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she 
did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was 
saying, she was not going to believe it until 
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, 
however, was choosing another lemon drop and did 
not answer. 

“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last 
night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He 
went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and 
James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” 

Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall 
gasped. 

“Lily and James ... I can’t believe it ... I didn’t want to 
believe it ... Oh, Albus ...” 

Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the 
shoulder. “I know ... I know ...” he said heavily. 

Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went 
on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the 
Potters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t 
kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but 
they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, 
Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why 
he’s gone.” 

Dumbledore nodded glumly. 

“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After 
all he’s done ... all the people he’s killed ... he couldn’t 
kill a little boy? It’s just astounding ... of all the 
things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven 
did Harry survive?” 

“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may 
never know.” 

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief 
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. 
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden 
watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very 
odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; 
instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It 
must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, 
because he put it back in his pocket and said, 
“Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be 
here, by the way?” 

“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t 
suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all 
places?” 

“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. 
They’re the only family he has left now.” 

“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who 
live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her 

Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling 




feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you 
can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t 
find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got 
this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way 
up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter 
come and live here!” 

“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. 
“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything 
to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.” 

“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, 
sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, 
you think you can explain all this in a letter? These 
people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — 
a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was 
known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will 
be books written about Harry — every child in our 
world will know his name!” 

“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously 
over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be 
enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can 
walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even 
remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, 
growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take 
it?” 



Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her 
mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re 
right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, 
Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though 
she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. 

“Hagrid’s bringing him.” 

“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with 
something as important as this?” 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore. 

“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said 
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t 
pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what 
was that?” 

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around 
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and 
down the street for some sign of a headlight; it 
swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — 
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed 
on the road in front of them. 

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man 
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a 
normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked 
simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long 
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his 
face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his 
feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In 
his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of 
blankets. 

“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At 
last. And where did you get that motorcycle?” 

“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the 
giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he 
spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, 
sir.” 

“No problems, were there?” 

“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him 
out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ 
around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” 



Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward 
over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a 
baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair 
over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped 
cut, like a bolt of lightning. 

“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Hell have that scar forever.” 

“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” 

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. 

I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect 
map of the London Underground. Well — give him 
here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” 

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned 
toward the Dursleys’ house. 

“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked 
Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry 
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, 
whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl 
like a wounded dog. 

“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the 
Muggles!” 

“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted 
handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c- 
can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little 
Harry off ter live with Muggles — ” 

“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, 
Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall 
whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as 
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and 
walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the 
Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it 
inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the 
other two. For a full minute the three of them stood 
and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders 
shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and 
the twinkling light that usually shone from 
Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. 

“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no 
business staying here. We may as well go and join the 
celebrations.” 

“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best 
get this bike away. G ’night, Professor McGonagall — 
Professor Dumbledore, sir.” 

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid 
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the 
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off 
into the night. 

“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” 
said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor 
McGonagall blew her nose in reply. 

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. 
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- 
Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light 
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive 
glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a 
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end 
of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets 
on the step of number four. 

“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his 
heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. 

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which 
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




place you would expect astonishing things to happen. 
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without 
waking up. One small hand closed on the letter 
beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was 
special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he 
would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. 

Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put 
out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next 
few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin 
Dudley. ... He couldn’t know that at this very 
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country 
were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed 
voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” 



Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 






THE VANASHIG GLASS 

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had 
woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but 
Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose 
on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass 
number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into 
their living room, which was almost exactly the same 
as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had 
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the 
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how 
much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been 
lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach 
ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley 
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the 
photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first 
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer 
game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his 
mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy 
lived in the house, too. 

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, 
but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it 



Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the 
day. 

“Up! Get up! Now!” 

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door 
again. 

“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward 
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan 
being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and 
tried to remember the dream he had been having. It 
had been a good one. There had been a flying 
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the 
same dream before. 

His aunt was back outside the door. 

“Are you up yet?” she demanded. 

“Nearly,” said Harry. 

“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the 
bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want 
everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” 

Harry groaned. 

“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the 
door. 

“Nothing, nothing ...” 

Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? 
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for 
socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after 
pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry 
was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the 
stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 
Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




When he was dressed he went down the hall into the 
kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all 
Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though 
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not 
to mention the second television and the racing bike. 
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a 
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated 
exercise — unless of course it involved punching 
somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, 
but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, 
but he was very fast. 

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark 
cupboard, but Harry had always been small and 
skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and 
skinnier than he really was because all he had to 
wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was 
about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin 
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green 
eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot 
of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had 
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked 
about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his 
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He 
had had it as long as he could remember, and the 
first question he could ever remember asking his 
Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. 

“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had 
said. “And don’t ask questions.” 

Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a 
quiet life with the Dursleys. 

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was 
turning over the bacon. 

“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning 
greeting. 

Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling 




About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top 
of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a 
haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the 
rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made 
no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over 
the place. 

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in 
the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like 
Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much 
neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair 
that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia 
often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — 
Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a 
wig. 

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, 
which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. 
Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His 
face fell. 

“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and 
father. “That’s two less than last year.” 

“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s pre"

HARRY 

POTTER 




/ 




THE WORST BIRTHDAY 

Not for the first time, an argument had broken out 
over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. 
Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of 
the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew 
Harry’s room. 

“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If 
you can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!” 

Harry tried, yet again, to explain. 

“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around 
outside. If I could just let her out at night — ” 

“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of 
fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. “I know 
what 11 happen if that owl’s let out.” 

He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. 

Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned 
by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley. 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 



“I want more bacon.” 



“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt 
Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We 
must build you up while we’ve got the chance. ... I 
don’t like the sound of that school food. ...” 

“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when / was 
at Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley 
gets enough, don’t you, son?” 

Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over 
either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to 
Harry. 

“Pass the frying pan.” 

“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry 
irritably. 

The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the 
family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his 
chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. 
Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands 
to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins 
throbbing in his temples. 

“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean 



“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, 
spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ 
WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” 

“But I — ” 

“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared 
Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. 



Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“I just — ” 



“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION 
OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” 

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale 
aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. 

“All right,” said Harry, “all right ...” 

Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded 
rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the 
corners of his small, sharp eyes. 

Ever since Harry had come home for the summer 
holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a 
bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry 
Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he 
was as not normal as it is possible to be. 

Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his 
first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have 
him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how 
Harry felt. 

He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a 
constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its 
secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though 
perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail 
arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, 
sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, 
visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to 
the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, 
Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding 
world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and 
fourteen players on broomsticks). 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and 
top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had 
been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle 
Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did 
the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House 
Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all 
summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went 
back to school without any of his homework done? 

The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a 
drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as 
they were concerned, having a wizard in the family 
was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had 
even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, 
to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the 
wizarding world. 

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle 
Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous 
black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and 
bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on 
the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant 
green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. 
He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a 
thin, lightning-shaped scar. 

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly 
unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only 
hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he 
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years 
before. 

At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow 
survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all 
time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and 
wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died 
in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his 
lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood 
why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the 
instant he had failed to kill Harry. 

Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s 
sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with 
the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept 
making odd things happen without meaning to, 
believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar 
in the car crash that had killed his parents. 

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to 
Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had 
taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his 
scar were famous . . . but now the school year was 
over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the 
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had 
rolled in something smelly. 

The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today 
happened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, 
his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a 
real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it 
completely ... 

At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat 
importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a 
very important day.” 

Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. 

“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of 
my career,” said Uncle Vernon. 

Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought 
bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid 
dinner party. He’d been talking of nothing else for two 
weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to 
dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge 
order from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills). 



Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“I think we should run through the schedule one 
more time,” said Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in 
position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be — ?” 

“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting 
to welcome them graciously to our home.” 

“Good, good. And Dudley?” 

“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a 
foul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and 
Mrs. Mason?” 

“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. 

“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he 
rounded on Harry. “And you?” 

“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and 
pretending I’m not there,” said Harry tonelessly. 

“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them 
into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour 
them drinks. At eight-fifteen — ” 

“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia. 

“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ” 

“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. 
Mason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an 
invisible woman. 

“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia. 

“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. 

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending 
I’m not there,” said Harry dully. 

Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good 
compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?” 



“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. 

Mason. ... Do tell me where you bought your dress, 
Mrs. Mason. ...” 

“Perfect ... Dudley?” 

“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our 
hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ” 

This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. 
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, 
while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t 
see him laughing. 

“And you, boy?” 

Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. 

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending 
I’m not there,” he said. 

“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 

“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s 
going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take 
Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, 
and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any 
luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the 
news at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in 
Majorca this time tomorrow.” 

Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t 
think the Dursleys would like him any better in 
Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. 

“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner 
jackets for Dudley and me. And you,” he snarled at

Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s 
cleaning.” 

Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, 
sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on 
the garden bench, and sang under his breath: 

“Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...” 

No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the 
evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably 
into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than 
anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing 
Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron 
Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t 
seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had 
written to him all summer, even though Ron had said 
he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. 

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of 
unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to 
Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth 
the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use 
magic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the 
Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he 
might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped 
them from locking him in the cupboard under the 
stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first 
couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering 
nonsense words under his breath and watching 
Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs 
would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and 
Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the 
magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its 
appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten 
his birthday. 

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from 
Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to 
be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. ... 

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At 
the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face 
with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. 
Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he 
was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to 
regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s 
clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow 
escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking 
in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where 
Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his 
wide, mad eyes — 

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. 
He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge 
— and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous 
green eyes had appeared among the leaves. 

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated 
across the lawn. 

“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward 
him. 

The huge eyes blinked and vanished. 

“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot 
where they had been. 

“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right 
up to him. 

“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the 
days of the week.” 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come 
you haven’t got any cards? Haven’t you even got 
friends at that freak place?” 

“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my 
school,” said Harry coolly. 

Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping 
down his fat bottom. 

“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said 
suspiciously. 

“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to 
set it on fire,” said Harry. 

Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic 
on his fat face. 

“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic 
— he said hell chuck you out of the house — and you 
haven’t got anywhere else to go — you haven’t got any 
friends to take you — ” 

“ Jiggery pokeryV ’ said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus 
pocus — squiggly wiggly — ” 

“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet 
as he dashed back toward the house. “MUUUUM! 

He’s doing you know what!” 

Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither 
Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt 
Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but he still 
had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head 
with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to 
do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d 
finished. 



Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice 
cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, 
mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and 
watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. 
The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his 
neck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s 
bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had 
been thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any 
friends at Hogwarts. ... 

Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he 
thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower 
beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. 

It was half past seven in the evening when at last, 
exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him. 

“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!” 

Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming 
kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: 
a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. 
A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. 

“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped 
Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a 
lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already 
wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. 

Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful 
supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia 
whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!” 

As he passed the door to the living room, Harry 
caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow 
ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the 
upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle 
Vernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the 
stairs. 

Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Remember, boy — one sound — ” 

Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped 
inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his 
bed. 

The trouble was, there was already someone sitting 
on it. 



Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 






DOBBY’S WARNING 

Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close 
thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat- 
like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis 
balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had 
been watching him out of the garden hedge that 
morning. 

As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s 
voice from the hall. 

“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” 

The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low 
that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. 
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an 
old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. 

“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously. 

“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched 
voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. “So

long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an 
honor it is. ...” 

“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and 
sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was 
asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, “What are 
you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead 
he said, “Who are you?” 

“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said 
the creature. 

“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be 
rude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me 
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” 

Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the 
living room. The elf hung his head. 

“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry 
quickly, “but, er, is there any particular reason you’re 
here?” 

“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come 
to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders 
where to begin. ...” 

“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. 

To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy 
tears. 

“S-sit down).” he wailed. “Never ... never ever ...” 

Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. 

“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you 
or anything — ” 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never 
been asked to sit down by a wizard — like an equal — 



Harry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the 
same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where 
he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly 
doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat 
with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of 
watery adoration. 

“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said 
Harry, trying to cheer him up. 

Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he 
leapt up and started banging his head furiously on 
the window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!” 

“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed, 
springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed — 
Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud 
screech and was beating her wings wildly against the 
bars of her cage. 

“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who 
had gone slightly cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill 
of his family, sir. ...” 

“Your family?” 

“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. ... Dobby is a 
house-elf — bound to serve one house and one family 
forever. ...” 

“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously. 
Dobby shuddered. 



Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself 
most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will 
have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they 
ever knew, sir — ” 

“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the 
oven door?” 

“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to 
punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get 
on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do 
extra punishments. ...” 

“But why don’t you leave? Escape?” 

“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will 
never set Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family 
until he dies, sir. ...” 

Harry stared. 

“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another 
four weeks,” he said. “This makes the Dursleys sound 
almost human. Can’t anyone help you? Can’t I?” 

Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken. 

Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude. 

“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet. 
If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you’re 
here — ” 

“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has 
heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, 
Dobby never knew. ...” 

Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, 
“Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load 



Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




of rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; 
that’s Hermione, she — ” 

But he stopped quickly, because thinking about 
Hermione was painful. 

“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby 
reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. “Harry Potter 
speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named — ” 

“Voldemort?” said Harry. 

Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and 
moaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the 
name!” 

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people 
don’t like it. My friend Ron — ” 

He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, 
too. 

Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as 
headlights. 

“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry 
Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just 
weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped yet again.” 

Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with 
tears. 

“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of 
the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter 
is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers 
already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, 
to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in

the oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back 
to Hogwarts.” 

There was a silence broken only by the chink of 
knives and forks from downstairs and the distant 
rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice. 

“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back 
— term starts on September first. It’s all that’s 
keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like here. 

I don’t belong here. I belong in your world — at 
Hogwarts.” 

“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so 
hard his ears flapped. “Harry Potter must stay where 
he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry 
Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal 
danger.” 

“Why?” said Harry in surprise. 

“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most 
terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispered Dobby, 
suddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has known it for 
months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in 
peril. He is too important, sir!” 

“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s 
plotting them?” 

Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged 
his head frantically against the wall. 

“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop 
him. “You can’t tell me. I understand. But why are 
you warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought 
struck him. “Hang on — this hasn’t got anything to 
do with Vol — sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it? 
Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




You could just shake or nod,” he added hastily as 
Dobby’s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. 

Slowly, Dobby shook his head. 

“Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir — ” 

But Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be 
trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was 
completely lost. 

“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?” 

Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever. 

“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a 
chance of making horrible things happen at 
Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, 
for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t 
you?” 

Dobby bowed his head. 

“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster 
Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby 
has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of He- 
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his 
strength. But, sir” — Dobby’s voice dropped to an 
urgent whisper — “there are powers Dumbledore 
doesn’t ... powers no decent wizard ...” 

And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off 
the bed, seized Harry’s desk lamp, and started 
beating himself around the head with earsplitting 
yelps. 

A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later 
Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon 



Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




coming into the hall, calling, “Dudley must have left 
his television on again, the little tyke!” 

“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby 
in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the 
bed just as the door handle turned. 

“What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said 
Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly 
close to Harry’s. “You’ve just ruined the punch line of 
my Japanese golfer joke. ... One more sound and 
you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!” 

He stomped flat-footed from the room. 

Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. 

“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to 
go back to Hogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got — 
well, I think I’ve got friends.” 

“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said 
Dobby slyly. 

“I expect they’ve just been — wait a minute,” said 
Harry, frowning. “How do you know my friends 
haven’t been writing to me?” 

Dobby shuffled his feet. 

“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Dobby 
did it for the best — ” 

“Have you been stopping my letters?” 

“Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping 
nimbly out of Harry’s reach, he pulled a thick wad of 
envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was 
wearing. Harry could make out Hermione’s neat 

Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




writing, Ron’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that 
looked as though it was from the Hogwarts 
gamekeeper, Hagrid. 

Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. 

“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. ... Dobby hoped ... if 
Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . . 
Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. 



Harry wasn’t listening. He made a grab for the letters, 
but Dobby jumped out of reach. 

“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his 
word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this 
is a danger you must not face! Say you won’t go back, 
sir!” 

“No,” said Harry angrily. “Give me my friends’ letters!” 

“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” said the 
elf sadly. 

Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the 
bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the 
stairs. 

Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, 
trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six 
steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking 
around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard 
Uncle Vernon saying, ""... tell Petunia that very funny 
story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. 
She’s been dying to hear ...” 

Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his 
stomach disappear. 



Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




Aunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the 
mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating 
up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the 
corner crouched Dobby. 

“No,” croaked Harry. “Please ... they’ll kill me. ...” 
“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school 



“Dobby ... please ...” 

“Say it, sir — ” 

“I can’t — ” 

Dobby gave him a tragic look. 

“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own 
good.” 

The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping 
crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the 
dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby 
vanished. 

There were screams from the dining room and Uncle 
Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with 
shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia’s 
pudding. 

At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would 
manage to gloss the whole thing over. (“Just our 
nephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets 
him, so we kept him upstairs. ...”) He shooed the 
shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised 
Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life 
when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. 
Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer 
Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the 
kitchen clean. 

Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his 
deal — if it hadn’t been for the owl. 

Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after- 
dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through 
the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. 
Mason’s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason 
screamed like a banshee and ran from the house 
shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long 
enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally 
afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask 
whether this was their idea of a joke. 

Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for 
support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a 
demonic glint in his tiny eyes. 

“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the 
owl had delivered. “Go on — read it!” 

Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was 
used at your place of residence this evening at twelve 
minutes past nine. 

As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to 
perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on 
your part may lead to expulsion from said school 
(Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage 
Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). 

We would also ask you to remember that any magical 
activity that risks notice by members of the non- 

P a g e | 24 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense 
under section 13 of the International Confederation of 
Warlocks’ Statute of Secrecy. 

Enjoy your holidays! 

Yours sincerely, 

Mafalda Hopkirk 

IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE 
Ministry of Magic 

Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. 

“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic 
outside school,” said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam 
dancing in his eyes. “Forgot to mention it. ... Slipped 
your mind, I daresay. ...” 

He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, 
all his teeth bared. “Well, I’ve got news for you, boy. ... 
I’m locking you up. ... You’re never going back to that 
school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself 
out — they 11 expel you!” 

And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back 
upstairs. 

Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following 
morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window. 
He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so 
that small amounts of food could be pushed inside 
three times a day. They let Harry out to use the 
bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was 
locked in his room around the clock. 



Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign 
of relenting, and Harry couldn’t see any way out of his 
situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking 
behind the bars on the window and wondered 
miserably what was going to happen to him. 

What was the good of magicking himself out of his 
room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life 
at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that 
the Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as 
fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might 
have saved Harry from horrible happenings at 
Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he’d 
probably starve to death anyway. 

The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia’s hand 
appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the 
room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, 
jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone- 
cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he 
crossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the 
soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her 
empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave 
him a look of deep disgust. 

“It’s no good turning your beak up at it — that’s all 
we’ve got,” said Harry grimly. 

He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the 
cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even 
hungrier than he had been before the soup. 

Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, 
what would happen if he didn’t turn up at Hogwarts? 
Would someone be sent to see why he hadn’t come 
back? Would they be ab"

Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. ,
"For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more ",
"than any other time of year. For another, he really ",
wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in ,
"secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to ",
be a wizard. ,
,
"It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his ",
"stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his ",
"head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large ",
leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda ,
Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry ,
"moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, ",
frowning as he looked for something that would help ,
"him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth ",
Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.” ,
,
The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking ,
paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the ,
"bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the ",
"book, and read: ",

,
Non-magic people (more commonly known as ,
Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval ,
"times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare ",
"occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, ",
burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard ,
would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and ,
then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a ,
"gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird ",
enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed ,
herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in ,
various disguises. ,
,
Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached ,
underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of ,
parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed ,
"the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to ",
"write, pausing every now and then to listen, because ",
if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill ,
"on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find ",
himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for ,
the rest of the summer. ,
,
"The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was ",
the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer ,
"holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, ",
"Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were ",
"Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude ",
"toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had been a ",
"witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned ",
"under the Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and ",
Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as ,
"downtrodden as possible, they would be able to ",
"squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had ",
been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of ,
anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the ,
last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and ,
"Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to ",
"lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and ",

"broomstick at the start of the summer break, and ",
forbid him to talk to the neighbors. ,
,
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real ,
"problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts ",
had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the ,
"essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking ",
"potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher, ",
"Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an ",
excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had ,
therefore seized his chance in the first week of the ,
"holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and ",
Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire ,
"Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices, ",
"so that the rest of the street would notice it too), ",
,
"Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the ",
"cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his ",
"books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as ",
"he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the ",
Dursleys need never know that he was studying ,
magic by night. ,
,
Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his ,
"aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already ",
"in an especially bad mood with him, all because he’d ",
received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one ,
week into the school vacation. ,
,
"Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at ",
"Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This ",
"meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but ",
had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it ,
had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call. ,
,
“Vernon Dursley speaking.” ,
,
"Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, ",
froze as he heard Ron’s voice answer. ,
,
,
,
Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
“HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT — ,
TO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!” ,
,
Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped ,
"and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring ",
at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm. ,
,
“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the ,
mouthpiece. “WHO ARE YOU?” ,
,
"“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he ",
and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends ,
of a football field. “I’M — A — FRIEND — OF — ,
HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL — ” ,
,
"Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, ",
who was rooted to the spot. ,
,
"“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, ",
"now holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though ",
frightened it might explode. “I DONT KNOW WHAT ,
SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER ,
CONTACT ME AGAIN! DONT YOU COME NEAR MY ,
FAMILY!” ,
,
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as ,
if dropping a poisonous spider. ,
,
The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ,
ever. ,
,
“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE ,
LIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU!” Uncle Vernon had ,
"roared, spraying Harry with spit. ",
,
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into ,
"trouble, because he hadn’t called again. Harry’s other ",
"best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t ",
been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had ,
,
Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, ",
"because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s ",
"year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to ",
"use a telephone, and would probably have had ",
enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts. ,
,
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding ,
"friends for five long weeks, and this summer was ",
turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There ,
was just one very small improvement — after ,
swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to ,
"any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his ",
"owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in ",
because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked ,
in her cage all the time. ,
,
Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and ,
paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house ,
"was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his ",
"enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry ",
thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. ,
,
Perhaps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. ... ,
,
He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old ,
"pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A ",
"History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got ",
out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard ,
"under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and ",
checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his ,
bedside table. ,
,
It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach ,
"gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old, ",
"without realizing it, for a whole hour. ",
,
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little ,
he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never ,
received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had ,
,
,
,
Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had ",
no reason to suppose they would remember this one. ,
,
"Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s ",
"large, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on ",
"the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a ",
long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been ,
absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried ,
about her: she’d been gone this long before. But he ,
hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living ,
creature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of ,
him. ,
,
"Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his ",
"age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His ",
"jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had ",
"been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The ",
"eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his ",
"forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin ",
"scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning. ",
,
"Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was ",
"the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the ",
"Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of ",
"the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because ",
Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. ,
"They had been murdered, murdered by the most ",
"feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord ",
Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack ,
"with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where ",
"Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had ",
"rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, ",
,
Voldemort had fled. ... ,
,
But Harry had come face-to-face with him at ,
Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he ,
"stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was ",
lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday. ,
,
,
,
Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, ",
perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse ,
"dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing ",
"absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before ",
Harry realized what he was seeing. ,
,
"Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing ",
"larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided ",
"creature, and it was flapping in Harry’s direction. He ",
"stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For ",
"a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window ",
"latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then ",
the bizarre creature soared over one of the street ,
"lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it ",
"was, leapt aside. ",
,
"Through the window soared three owls, two of them ",
"holding up the third, which appeared to be ",
unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on ,
"Harry’s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and ",
"gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was ",
a large package tied to its legs. ,
,
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his ,
"name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley ",
"family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords ",
"around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then ",
carried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one ,
"bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to ",
gulp some water. ,
,
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of ,
"them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig. ",
"She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely ",
pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate ,
"nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then ",
flew across the room to join Errol. ,
,
,
,
Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome ",
"tawny one, but he knew at once where it had come ",
"from, because in addition to a third package, it was ",
carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When ,
"Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its ",
"feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off ",
through the window into the night. ,
,
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s ,
"package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a ",
"present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday ",
"card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the ",
envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a ,
newspaper clipping. ,
,
The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding ,
"newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in ",
the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry ,
"picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read: ",
,
MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE ,
,
SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE ,
,
"Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts ",
"Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual ",
Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. ,
,
"A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, “We ",
will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in ,
"Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse ",
breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank. ” ,
,
The Weasley family will be spending a month in ,
"Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year ",
"at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children ",
currently attend. ,
,
,
,
Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin ",
spread across his face as he saw all nine of the ,
"Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of ",
"a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, ",
"balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all ",
(though the black-and-white picture didn’t show it) ,
with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the ,
"picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, ",
"Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his ",
"little sister, Ginny. ",
,
Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a ,
"large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were ",
very nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron’s ,
letter and unfolded it. ,
,
"Dear Harry, ",
,
Happy birthday! ,
,
"Look, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope ",
"the Muggles didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, ",
and he reckons I shouldn’t have shouted. ,
,
It’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all ,
the tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses those ,
old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn’t let ,
Ginny come in the last one. There were all these ,
"mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who’d broken in ",
and grown extra heads and stuff. ,
,
I couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet ,
Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it’s gone on ,
"this trip, but they’re going to buy me a new wand for ",
next year. ,
,
Harry remembered only too well the occasion when ,
Ron’s old wand had snapped. It had happened when ,
,
,
,
Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts ,
had crashed into a tree on the school grounds. ,
,
We’ll be back about a week before term starts and ,
we’ll be going up to London to get my wand and our ,
new books. Any chance of meeting you there? ,
,
Don’t let the Muggles get you down! ,
,
"Try and come to London, ",
,
Ron ,
,
PS. Percy’s Head Boy. He got the letter last week. ,
,
"Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who ",
"was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was ",
looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head ,
Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his ,
"neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the ",
Egyptian sun. ,
,
Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. ,
Inside was what looked like a miniature glass ,
spinning top. There was another note from Ron ,
beneath it. ,
,
Harry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s ,
"someone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light ",
up and spin. Bill says it’s rubbish sold for wizard ,
"tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at ",
dinner last night. But he didn’t realize Fred and George ,
had put beetles in his soup. ,
,
Bye — ,
,
Ron ,
,
,
,
Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside ,
"table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, ",
reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked ,
"at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the ",
parcel Hedwig had brought. ,
,
"Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, ",
"and a letter, this time from Hermione. ",
,
"Dear Harry, ",
,
Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to ,
your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you’re all right. ,
,
I’m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn’t ,
know how I was going to send this to you — what if ,
they’d opened it at customs? — but then Hedwig ,
turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got ,
something for your birthday for a change. I bought your ,
present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in ,
the Daily Prophet (I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so ,
good to keep up with what’s going on in the wizarding ,
world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a ,
week ago? I bet he’s learning loads. I’m really jealous ,
— the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating. ,
,
There’s some interesting local history of witchcraft ,
"here, too. I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic ",
essay to include some of the things I’ve found out. I ,
hope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment more ,
than Professor Binns asked for. ,
,
Ron says he’s going to be in London in the last week of ,
the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and ,
"uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I’ll see ",
you on the Hogwarts Express on September first! ,
,
Love from ,
,
,
,
Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
Hermione ,
,
,
,
PS. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really ,
pleased. ,
,
Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it. ,
,
Harry laughed as he put Hermione ’s letter aside and ,
picked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing ,
"Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of ",
very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a ,
huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a ,
"sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped ",
"across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit. ",
,
"“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the ",
case to look inside. ,
,
There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish ,
"Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig ",
"Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom ",
"for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself ",
Broomcare. ,
,
"Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed ",
"most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most ",
popular sport in the magical world — highly ,
"dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. ",
Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; ,
he had been the youngest person in a century to be ,
picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of ,
Harry’s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two ,
Thousand racing broom. ,
,
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his ,
last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the ,
"brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the ",
Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of ,
"paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, ",
Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel ",
"gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it ",
snapped loudly — as though it had jaws. ,
,
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send ,
"him anything dangerous on purpose, but then, ",
,
Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what ,
was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend ,
"giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from ",
"men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his ",
cabin. ,
,
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly ,
again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside ,
"table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over ",
"his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of ",
the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled. ,
,
And out fell — a book. Harry just had time to register ,
"its handsome green cover, emblazoned with the ",
"golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it ",
flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the ,
bed like some weird crab. ,
,
"“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered. ",
,
The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and ,
shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it ,
stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space ,
under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still ,
"fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees ",
and reached toward it. ,
,
“Ouch!” ,
,
The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped ,
"past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry ",
"scrambled around, threw himself forward, and ",
,
,
,
Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, ",
sleepy grunt in the room next door. ,
,
Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry ,
"clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms, ",
"hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, ",
which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book ,
"shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, ",
so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for ,
Hagrid’s card. ,
,
"Dear Harry, ",
,
Happy birthday! ,
,
Think you might find this useful for next year. ,
,
Won’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you. ,
,
Hope the Muggles are treating you right. ,
,
"All the best, ",
,
Hagrid ,
,
It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a ,
"biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid’s ",
"card up next to Ron’s and Hermione’s, grinning more ",
broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from ,
Hogwarts left. ,
,
"Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry ",
"slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of ",
"parchment within, and read: ",
,
"Dear Mr. Potter, ",
,
Please note that the new school year will begin on ,
September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave ,
,
Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"from King’s Cross station, platform nine and three- ",
"quarters, at eleven o’clock. ",
,
Third years are permitted to visit the village of ,
Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the ,
enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to ,
sign. ,
,
A list of books for next year is enclosed. ,
,
"Yours sincerely, ",
,
Professor M. McGonagall ,
Deputy Headmistress ,
,
Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and ,
"looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful ",
to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an ,
"entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot ",
there. But how on earth was he going to persuade ,
Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form? ,
,
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two ,
o’clock in the morning. ,
,
Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form ,
"when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and ",
reached up to cross off another day on the chart he’d ,
"made for himself, counting down the days left until ",
his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses ,
"and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday ",
cards. ,
,
"Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment ",
"Harry Potter felt just like everyone else — glad, for the ",
"first time in his life, that it was his birthday. ",
,
,

,
,
,
,
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE ,
,
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to ,
find the three Dursleys already sitting around the ,
kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new ,
"television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present ",
"for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about ",
the long walk between the fridge and the television in ,
the living room. Dudley had spent most of the ,
"summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on ",
the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate ,
continually. ,
,
"Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a ",
"large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of ",
"mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, ",
none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had ,
"noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too ",
used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of ,
toast and then looked up at the reporter on the ,
"television, who was halfway through a report on an ",
escaped convict: ,
,
,
,
Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
... The public is warned that Black is armed and ,
extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set ,
"up, and any sighting of Black should be reported ",
immediately.” ,
,
"“No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle ",
"Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the ",
"prisoner. “Look at the state of him, the filthy ",
layabout! Look at his hair!” ,
,
"He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy ",
hair had always been a source of great annoyance to ,
Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the ,
"television, however, whose gaunt face was ",
"surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry ",
felt very well groomed indeed. ,
,
The reporter had reappeared. ,
,
“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will ,
announce today — ” ,
,
"“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at ",
the reporter. “You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s ,
escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be ,
coming up the street right now!” ,
,
"Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, ",
whipped around and peered intently out of the ,
kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would ,
simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. ,
She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent ,
"most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding ",
neighbors. ,
,
"“When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding ",
"the table with his large purple fist, “that hanging’s the ",
only way to deal with these people?” ,
,
,
,
Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still ",
squinting into next door’s runner beans. ,
,
"Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his ",
"watch, and added, “I’d better be off in a minute, ",
Petunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten.” ,
,
"Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the ",
"Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth ",
with an unpleasant bump. ,
,
“Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh — she’s not ,
"coming here, is she?” ",
,
Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister. Even though ,
she was not a blood relative of Harry’s (whose mother ,
"had been Aunt Petunia’s sister), he had been forced to ",
call her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the ,
"country, in a house with a large garden, where she ",
"bred bulldogs. She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive, ",
"because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, ",
but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in ,
Harry’s mind. ,
,
"At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had ",
whacked Harry around the shins with her walking ,
stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical ,
"statues. A few years later, she had turned up at ",
Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and ,
"a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the ",
"year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had ",
accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. ,
Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up ,
"a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off ",
until past midnight. The memory of this incident still ,
brought tears of laughter to Dudley’s eyes. ,
,
"“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled, ",
“and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat ,
,
Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
finger threateningly at Harry — “we need to get a few ,
things straight before I go and collect her.” ,
,
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the ,
television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle ,
Vernon was Dudley’s favorite form of entertainment. ,
,
"“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil ",
tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.” ,
,
"“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s ",
talking to me.” ,
,
"“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he ",
"had not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know ",
"anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — ",
"any funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself, ",
got me?” ,
,
"“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth. ",
,
"“And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes ",
"now slits in his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge ",
you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably ,
Criminal Boys.” ,
,
“What?” Harry yelled. ,
,
"“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be ",
"trouble,” spat Uncle Vernon. ",
,
"Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at ",
"Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge ",
coming for a week-long visit — it was the worst ,
"birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, ",
including that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. ,
,
,
,
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,

hair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow tie.” ,

to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s ,
voice. ,
,
"“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle ",
"Vernon’s large, purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll ",
"have to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I ",
accidentally let something slip?” ,
,

"quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to ",

he gathered up all his presents and his birthday ,
cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with ,

Harry Potter - THE RIDDLE HOUSE,"/ 




THE RIDDLE HOUSE 

The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the 
Riddle House,” even though it had been many years 
since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a 
hill overlooking the village, some of its windows 
boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading 
unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, 
and easily the largest and grandest building for miles 
around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, 
and unoccupied. 

The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house 
was “creepy.” Half a century ago, something strange 
and horrible had happened there, something that the 
older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss 
when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had 
been picked over so many times, and had been 
embroidered in so many places, that nobody was 
quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version 
of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty 
years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s 
morning, when the Riddle House had still been well

kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing 
room to find all three Riddles dead. 

The maid had run screaming down the hill into the 
village and roused as many people as she could. 

“Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! 
Still in their dinner things!” 

The police were summoned, and the whole of Little 
Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill- 
disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath 
pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they 
had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs. 
Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their 
grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All 
the villagers cared about was the identity of their 
murderer — for plainly, three apparently healthy 
people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the 
same night. 

The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade 
that night; the whole village seemed to have turned 
out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for 
leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived 
dramatically in their midst and announced to the 
suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce 
had just been arrested. 

“Frank!” cried several people. “Never!” 

Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone 
in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle 
House. Frank had come back from the war with a 
very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud 
noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever 
since. 



Page | 3 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear 
more details. 



“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly 
listening villagers, after her fourth sherry. 

“Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa 
once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to 
mix, he didn’t.” 

“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar, “he had a hard 
war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to 



“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked 
the cook. “There’s been a spare key hanging in the 
gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember! 
Nobody forced the door last night! No broken 
windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big 
house while we was all sleeping. ...” 

The villagers exchanged dark looks. 

“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, 
right enough,” grunted a man at the bar. 

“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the 
landlord. 

“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of 
Frank, didn’t I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the 
corner. 

“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently. “I 
remember, when he was a kid ...” 

By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little 
Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the 
Riddles. 



Page | 4 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, 
in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was 
stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was 
innocent, and that the only person he had seen near 
the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been 
a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. 
Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and 
the police were quite sure that Frank had invented 
him. 

Then, just when things were looking very serious for 
Frank, the report on the Riddles’ bodies came back 
and changed everything. 

The police had never read an odder report. A team of 
doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded 
that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, 
shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could 
tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a 
tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all 
appeared to be in perfect health — apart from the fact 
that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as 
though determined to find something wrong with the 
bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror 
upon his or her face — but as the frustrated police 
said, whoever heard of three people being frightened 
to death? 

As there was no proof that the Riddles had been 
murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. 
The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton 
churchyard, and their graves remained objects of 
curiosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid 
a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his 
cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. 

“ ’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t 
care what the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged 



Page | 5 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




Man. “And if he had any decency, he’d leave here, 
knowing as how we knows he did it.” 

But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden 
for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and 
then the next — for neither family stayed long. 

Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new 
owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, 
which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall 
into disrepair. 

The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these 
days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they 
said in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,” 
though nobody was very clear what these might be. 
The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the 
gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy- 
seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer 
than ever, but could be seen pottering around the 
flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds 
were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to 
suppress them. 

Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend 
with either. Boys from the village made a habit of 
throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle 
House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank 
worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they 
broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that 
old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds 
amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused 
them to see him limping across the garden, 
brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. 
Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him 
because they, like their parents and grandparents, 
thought him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one 
night in August and saw something very odd up at 
the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had 
gone one step further in their attempts to punish him. 
Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire -J.K. Rowling 




It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining 
him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and 
limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of 
refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in 
his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he 
looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights 
glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once 
what was going on. The boys had broken into the 
house again, and judging by the flickering quality of 
the light, they had started a fire. 

Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had 
deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had 
taken him in for questioning about the Riddles’ 
deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back 
upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was 
soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing 
a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked 
up his walking stick, which was propped against the 
wall, and set off into the night. 

The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of 
being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank 
limped around to the back of the house until he 
reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took 
out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the 
door noiselessly. 

He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had 
not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although 
it was very dark, he remembered where the door into 
the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his 
nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any 
sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He 
reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to 
the large mullioned windows on either side of the 
front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing 
the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it 
muffled the sound of his feet and stick. 

Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire -J.K. Rowling 




On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once 
where the intruders were: At the very end of the 
passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone 
through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across 
the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, 
grasping his walking stick firmly. Several feet from 
the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the 
room beyond. 

The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This 
surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened 
intently, for a man’s voice spoke within the room; it 
sounded timid and fearful. 

“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you 
are still hungry.” 

“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a 
man — but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as 
a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that 
voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s 
neck stand up. “Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.” 

Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better 
to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put 
down upon some hard surface, and then the dull 
scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across 
the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his 
back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was 
wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald 
patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of 
sight again. 

“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice. 

“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice 
nervously. “She set out to explore the house, I think. 



Page | 8 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said 
the second voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The 
journey has tired me greatly.” 

Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer 
to the door, listening very hard. There was a pause, 
and then the man called Wormtail spoke again. 

“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay 
here?” 

“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The 
place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot 
proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the 
Quidditch World Cup is over.” 

Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and 
rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, 
he had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a 
word at all. 

“The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said 
Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously 
into his ear.) “Forgive me, but — I do not understand 
— why should we wait until the World Cup is over?” 

“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are 
pouring into the country from all over the world, and 
every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on 
duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, 
checking and double-checking identities. They will be 
obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice 
anything. So we wait.” 

Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had 
distinctly heard the words “Ministry of Magic,” 
“wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly, each of these 
expressions meant something secret, and Frank could 
think of only two sorts of people who would speak in 
Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire -J.K. Rowling 




code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold 
on his walking stick once more, and listened more 
closely still. 

“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail 
said quietly. 

“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a 
note of menace in the cold voice now. 

A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke, 
the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he 
was forcing himself to say this before he lost his 
nerve. 

“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.” 

Another pause, more protracted, and then — 

“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice 
softly. “I see ...” 

“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!” 
said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. “The boy is 
nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we 
were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard — 
the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you 
allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know 
that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could 
be back here in as little as two days with a suitable 
person — ” 

“I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice 
softly, “that is true. ...” 

“My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding 
thoroughly relieved now. “Laying hands on Harry 
Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected — ” 



Page | 10 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




“And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a 
substitute? I wonder . . . perhaps the task of nursing 
me has become wearisome for you, “Wormtail? Could 
this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing 
more than an attempt to desert me?” 

“My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all 



“Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can 
always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever 
returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you 
look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. ...” 

“No! My devotion to Your Lordship — ” 

“Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You 
would not be here if you had anywhere else to go. 

How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding 
every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?” 

“But you seem so much stronger, My Lord — ” 

“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger, 
and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of 
the little health I have regained under your clumsy 
care. Silencel” 

Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell 
silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear 
nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man 
spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss. 

“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have 
already explained to you, and I will use no other. I 
have waited thirteen years. A few more months will 
make no difference. As for the protection surrounding 
the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is 
needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail — 

Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full 
extent of Lord Voldemort’s wrath — ” 

“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his 
voice now. “All through our journey I have gone over 
the plan in my head — My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s 
disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if 
we proceed, if I murder — ” 

“IP” whispered the second voice. “If? If you follow the 
plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that 
anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and 
without fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but 
in my present condition ... Come, Wormtail, one more 
death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not 
asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful 
servant will have rejoined us — ” 

“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest 
trace of sullenness in his voice. 

“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody 
whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, 
unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.” 

“I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely 
a sulky edge to his voice now. “I was the one who 
found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.” 

“That is true,” said the second man, sounding 
amused. “A stroke of brilliance I would not have 
thought possible from you, Wormtail — though, if 
truth be told, you were not aware how useful she 
would be when you caught her, were you?” 

“I — I thought she might be useful, My Lord — ” 

“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel 
amusement more pronounced than ever. “However, I 

Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




do not deny that her information was invaluable. 
Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and 
for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will 
allow you to perform an essential task for me, one 
that many of my followers would give their right 
hands to perform. ...” 

“R-really, My Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded 
terrified again. 

“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the 
surprise? Your part will come at the very end ... but I 
promise you, you will have the honor of being just as 
useful as Bertha Jorkins.” 

“You ... you ...” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded 
hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. “You 
. . . are going ... to kill me too?” 

“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why 
would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She 
was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite 
useless. In any case, awkward questions would have 
been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with 
the news that she had met you on her holidays. 
Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well 
not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside 
inns. ...” 

Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank 
could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh 
— an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech. 

“We could have modified her memory? But Memory 
Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I 
proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to 
her memory not to use the information I extracted 
from her, Wormtail.” 



Page | 13 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware 
that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery 
with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a 
woman. He was talking about it without any kind of 
remorse — with amusement. He was dangerous — a 
madman. And he was planning more murders — this 
boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was — was in danger — 

Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the 
time to go to the police. He would creep out of the 
house and head straight for the telephone box in the 
village . . . but the cold voice was speaking again, and 
Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, 
listening with all his might. 

“One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts 
... Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is 
decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet ... 
I think I hear Nagini. ...” 

And the second man’s voice changed. He started 
making noises such as Frank had never heard before; 
he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. 
Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or 
seizure. 

And then Frank heard movement behind him in the 
dark passageway. He turned to look, and found 
himself paralyzed with fright. 

Something was slithering toward him along the dark 
corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of 
firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a 
gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, 
transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a 
wide, curving track through the thick dust on the 
floor, coming closer and closer — What was he to do? 
The only means of escape was into the room where 



Page | 14 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where 
he was the snake would surely kill him — 

But before he had made his decision, the snake was 
level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it 
was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing 
noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in 
seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had 
vanished through the gap. 

There was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the 
hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the 
room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and 
Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible 
idea. . . . This man could talk to snakes. 

Frank didn’t understand what was going on. He 
wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with 
his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs 
didn’t seem to want to move. As he stood there 
shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice 
switched abruptly to English again. 

“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said. 

“In-indeed, My Lord?” said Wormtail. 

“Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini, 
there is an old Muggle standing right outside this 
room, listening to every word we say.” 

Frank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There 
were footsteps, and then the door of the room was 
flung wide open. 

A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed 
nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a 
mixture of fear and alarm in his face. 



Page | 15 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




“Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your 
manners?” 

The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair 
before the fire, but Frank couldn’t see the speaker. 
The snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the 
rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet 
dog. 

Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still 
deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his 
walking stick and limped over the threshold. 

The fire was the only source of light in the room; it 
cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank 
stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it 
seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank 
couldn’t even see the back of his head. 

“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice. 

“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly, 
for now that he was inside the room, now that the 
time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; 
it had always been so in the war. 

“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly. “It 
means that you are not a wizard.” 

“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, 
his voice growing steadier. “All I know is I’ve heard 
enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You’ve 
done murder and you’re planning more! And I’ll tell 
you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration, “my 
wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back — ” 

“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly. 
“Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that 



Page | 16 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, 
Muggle, for he knows ... he always knows. ...” 

“Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I 
don’t think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn 
’round and face me like a man, why don’t you?” 

“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice, 
barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. “I 
am much, much more than a man. However ... why 
not? I will face you. ... Wormtail, come turn my chair 
around.” 

The servant gave a whimper. 

“You heard me, Wormtail.” 

Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would 
rather have done anything than approach his master 
and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small 
man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The 
snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed 
slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug. 

And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw 
what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the 
floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out 
a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never 
heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it 
raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a 
rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was 
dead before he hit the floor. 

Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter 
woke with a start.

THE SCAR 

Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though 
he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid 
dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old 
scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of 
lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though 
someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his 
skin. 

He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other 
reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which 
were on the bedside table. He put them on and his 
bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty 
orange light that was filtering through the curtains 
from the street lamp outside the window. 

Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still 
painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled 
out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, 
and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A 
skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright 
green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He 



Page | 18 



Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 



examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more 
closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging. 

Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming 
about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real. ... 
There had been two people he knew and one he 
didn’t. ... He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to 
remember. ... 

The dim picture of a darkened room came to him. ... 
There had been a snake on a hearth rug ... a small 
man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail ... and a cold, 
high voice ... the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt 
as though an ice cube had slipped down into his 
stomach at the very thought. ... 

He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what 
Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible. ... 
All Harry knew was that at the moment when 
Voldemort’s chair had swung around, and he, Harry, 
had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of 
horror, which had awoken him ... or had that been 
the pain in his scar? 

And who had the old man been? For there had 
definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him 
fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused. 

Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his 
bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly 
lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his 
cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as 
fast as he tried to hold on to them. ... Voldemort and 
Wormtail had been talking about someone they had 
killed, though Harry could not remember the name . . . 
and they had been plotting to kill someone else . . . 
him). 

Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, 
and stared around his bedroom as though expecting 

Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling 




to see something unusual there. As it happened, 
there were an extraordinary number of unusual 
things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open 
at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, 
broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. 
Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that 
was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which 
his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor 
beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been 
reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures 
in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange 
robes were zooming in and out of sight on 
broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another. 

Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and 
watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal 
by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop. 

Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch — in 
Harry’s opinion, the best sport in the world — 
couldn’t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying 
with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the 
window, and drew back the curtains to survey the 
street below. 

Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban 
street would be expected to look in the early hours of 
Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far 
as Harry could see through the darkness, there 
wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat. 

And yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to 
the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his 
scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered him; 

Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost 
all the bones from his right arm once and had them 
painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been 
pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long 
afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet 
from an airborne broomstick. He was used to bizarre 
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire -J.K. Rowling 




accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you 
attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry 
and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble. 

No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the 
last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because 
Voldemort had been close by. ... But Voldemort 
couldn’t be here, now. ... The idea of Voldemort 
lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. ... 

Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was 
he half-expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the 
swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he 
heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting 
snore from the next room. 

Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. 
There was no one in the house with him except Uncle 
Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were 
plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and 
painless. 

Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it 
wasn’t as though they were ever any help to him 
awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were 
Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles who 
hated and despised magic in any form, which meant 
that Harry was about as welcome in their house as 
dry rot. They had explained away Harry’s long 
absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by 
telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus’s Secure 
Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew 
perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry 
wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but 
they were still apt to blame him for anything that 
went wrong about the house. Harry had never been 
able to confide in them or tell them anything about 
his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going 
to them when they awoke, and telling them about his 
Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire -J.K. Rowling 




scar hurting him, and about his worries about 
Voldemort, was laughable. 

And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had 
come to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it 
hadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had 
the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn’t been for 
Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents. ... 

Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort — 
the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard 
who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years 
— arrived at his house and killed his father and 
mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on 
Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed 
of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady 
rise to power — and, incredibly, it had not worked. 
Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had 
rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with 
nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, 
and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely 
alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, 
Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret 
community of witches and wizards had lived for so 
long had lifted, Voldemort’s followers had disbanded, 
and Harry Potter had become famous. 

It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, 
on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had

POTTER 




I 




DUDLEY DEMENTED 

The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to 
a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square 
houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually 
gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that 
were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; 
the use of hosepipes had been banned due to 
drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and 
lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive 
had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, 
windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a 
nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was 
a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a 
flower bed outside number four. 

He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who 
had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone 
who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His 
jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and 
faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away 
from the uppers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not 
endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of 
people who thought scruffiness ought to be 
Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself 
behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was 
quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only way he 
would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt 
Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room 
window and looked straight down into the flower bed 
below. 

On the whole, Harry thought he was to be 
congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, 
perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard 
earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at 
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not 
hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as 
had happened every time he had tried sitting down in 
the living room and watching television with his aunt 
and uncle. 

Almost as though this thought had fluttered through 
the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, 
suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the boy’s stopped trying 
to butt in. Where is he anyway?” 

“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not 
in the house.” 

Uncle Vernon grunted. 

“Watching the news ...” he said scathingly. “I’d like to 
know what he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares 
what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s 
going on, doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! 
Anyway, it’s not as if there ’d be anything about his lot 
on our news — ” 

“Vernon, shh\” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s 
open!” 

“Oh — yes — sorry, dear ...” 

Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle 
about Fruit ’N Bran breakfast cereal while he watched 
Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby 
Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning 
and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that 
he was concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had 
recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever 
she met him in the street. She had rounded the 
corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s 
voice floated out of the window again. 

“Dudders out for tea?” 

“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got 
so many little friends, he’s so popular ...” 

Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys 
really were astonishingly stupid about their son, 
Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies 
about having tea with a different member of his gang 
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew 
perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea 
anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening 
vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, 
and throwing stones at passing cars and children. 
Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks 
around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the 
holidays wandering the streets, scavenging 
newspapers from bins along the way. 

The opening notes of the music that heralded the 
seven o’clock news reached Harry’s ears and his 
stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight — after a 
month of waiting — would be the night — 

“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill 
airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike 
reaches its second week — ” 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle 
Vernon over the end of the newsreader’s sentence, 
but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry’s 
stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had 
happened, it would surely have been the first item on 
the news; death and destruction were more important 
than stranded holidaymakers... 

He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the 
brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been 
the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary 
relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and 
always, growing more insistent all the time, the 
question of why nothing had happened yet... 

He kept listening, just in case there was some small 
clue, not recognized for what it really was by the 
Muggles — an unexplained disappearance, 
perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the 
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the 
drought in the Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next 
door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, “with his sprinklers on 
at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter that had 
almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous 
actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if 
we’re interested in their sordid affairs,” sniffed Aunt 
Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in 
every magazine she could lay her bony hands on). 

Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening 
sky as the newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the 
budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this 
summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in 
Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins 
went to find out more...” 

Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached 
water-skiing budgerigars, there was nothing else 
worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and 

Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing 
to crawl out from under the window. 

He had moved about two inches when several things 
happened in very quick succession. 

A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a 
gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car 
and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and 
the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ 
living room, and as though Harry had been waiting 
for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time 
pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden 
wand as if he were unsheathing a sword. But before 
he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his 
head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and 
the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even 
louder. 

Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes 
streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street 
and spot the source of the noise, but he had barely 
staggered upright again when two large purple hands 
reached through the open window and closed tightly 
around his throat. 

“Put — it — away\” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s 
ear. “Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” 

“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds 
they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage- 
like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a 
firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as the pain in the 
top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, 
Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he 
had received an electric shock — some invisible force 
seemed to have surged through his nephew, making 
him impossible to hold. 



Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, 
straightened up, and stared around. There was no 
sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but 
there were several faces peering through various 
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back 
into his jeans and tried to look innocent. 

“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at 
Mrs. Number Seven, who was glaring from behind her 
net curtains. “Did you hear that car backfire just 
now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!” 

He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all 
the curious neighbors had disappeared from their 
various windows, then the grin became a grimace of 
rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him. 

Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop 
just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon’s 
outstretched hands could resume their strangling. 

“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle 
Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury. 

“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept 
looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see 
the person who had made the cracking noise. 

“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside 
our — ” 

“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly. 

Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside 
Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid. 

“Why were you lurking under our window?” 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing 
under our window, boy?” 

“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned 
voice. 

His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. 

“Listening to the news! Again?” 

“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry. 

“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know 
what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any 
more of this listening to the news tosh! You know 
perfectly well that your lot ...” 

“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle 
Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely 
hear him, ""... that your lot don’t get on our news!” 

“That’s all you know,” said Harry. 

The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then 
Aunt Petunia said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are 
all those — ” she too lowered her voice so that Harry 
had to lip-read the next word, “ — owls — doing if 
they’re not bringing you news?” 

“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. 
“Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get 
all your news from those pestilential birds!” 

Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something 
to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and 
uncle could not possibly know how bad Harry felt at 
admitting it. 



Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“The owls ... aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry 
tonelessly. 

“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once. 

“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 

“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt 
Petunia. 

“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon. 

“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper 
rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, 
he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, 
stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off 
up the street. 

He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have 
to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for 
his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at 
the moment; he had much more pressing matters on 
his mind. 

Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been 
made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It 
was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made 
when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that 
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be 
following him right at this very moment? As this 
thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back 
down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely 
deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did 
not know how to become invisible... 

He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was 
taking, for he had pounded these streets so often 
lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts 
automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as 
he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was 
sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to him, why hadn’t 
they made contact, why were they hiding now? 

And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his 
certainty leaked away. 

Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. 
Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of 
contact from the world to which he belonged that he 
was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. 
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of 
something breaking inside a neighbor’s house? 

Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach 
and, before he knew it, the feeling of hopelessness 
that had plagued him all summer rolled over him 
once again... 

Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm 
at five o’clock so that he could pay the owl that 
delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point 
in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the 
front page before throwing it aside these days; when 
the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that 
Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and 
that was the only kind Harry cared about. 

If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying 
letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, 
though any expectation he had had that their letters 
would bring him news had long since been dashed. 

“We can’t say much about you-know-what, 
obviously...” “We’ve been told not to say anything 
important in case our letters go astray...” “We’re quite 
busy but I can’t give you details here...” “There’s a fair 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see 
you...” 

But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed 
too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had 
scribbled, “I expect we’ll be seeing you quite soon” 
inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As 
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their 
letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, 
presumably at Ron’s parents’ house. He could hardly 
bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the 
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he 
was so angry at them that he had thrown both their 
birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away 
unopened, though he had regretted this after eating 
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for 
dinner that night. 

And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why 
wasn’t he, Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself 
capable of handling much more than they? Had they 
all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it been he who 
had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being 
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly 
killed ... ? 

Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for 
the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough 
that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his 
nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking 
moments too. 

He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway 
along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of 
a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his 
godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how 
Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as 
empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at 



Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




least they contained words of caution and consolation 
instead of tantalizing hints: 

“ I know this must be frustrating for you...” “Keep your 
nose clean and everything will be okay...” “Be careful 
and don’t do anything rash...” 

Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia 
Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed 
toward the darkening play park, he had (by and large) 
done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the 
temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set 
off for the Burrow by himself. In fact Harry thought 
his behavior had been very good considering how 
frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet 
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in 
the hope of hearing something that might point to 
what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was 
quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who 
had served twelve years in the wizard prison, 

Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder 
he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone 
on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . 

Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off 
across the parched grass. The park was as empty as 
the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings 
he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends 
had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around 
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He 
would not be able to hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed 
again. Tomorrow he would have to think of some 
fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, 
he had nothing to look forward to but another 
restless, disturbed night, because even when he 
escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling 
dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in 
dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had 
something to do with the trapped feeling he had when 
Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead 
prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself 
that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very 
interesting anymore... In the past his scar hurting 
had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger 
again, but now that Voldemort was back they would 
probably remind him that its regular irritation was 
only to be expected... Nothing to worry about ... old 
news ... 

The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he 
wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, 
nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! 
And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for 
four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical 
world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so 
that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! 
How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? 
Why had Ron and Hermione got together without 
inviting him along too? How much longer was he 
supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and 
be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the 
stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort 
had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around 
in Harry’s head, and his insides writhed with anger as 
a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of 
the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that 
of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the 
park railings. 

He did not know how long he had sat on the swing 
before the sound of voices interrupted his musings 
and he looked up. The street-lamps from the 
surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong 
enough to silhouette a group of people making their 
way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, 
crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking 
noise came from several expensive racing bikes that 
they were wheeling along.

Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front 
was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, 
wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful 
gang. 

Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting 
and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a 
change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly 
told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently 
become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing 
Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as 
Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more 
formidable than he had seemed to Harry in the 
primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s 
first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of 
his cousin anymore but he still didn’t think that 
Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately 
was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all 
around were terrified of him — even more terrified 
than they were of “that Potter boy,” who, they had 
been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended 
St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys. 

Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass 
and wondered whom they had been beating up 
tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as 
he watched them. Come on ... look round ... I’m sitting 
here all alone... Come and have ago... 

If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would 
be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would 
Dudley do then? He wouldn’t want to lose face in 
front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of provoking 
Harry. . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s 
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him 
powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried 
hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he had his wand . . . 
let them try ... He’d love to vent some of his 
Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




frustration on the boys who had once made his life 
hell — 



But they did not turn around, they did not see him, 
they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the 
impulse to call after them... Seeking a fight was not a 
smart move... He must not use magic... He would be 
risking expulsion again... 

Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, 
heading along Magnolia Road. 

There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing 
rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what 
you’d have done ... 

He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and 
Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley 
turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime 
after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had 
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home 
after Dudley again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, 
Harry set off toward the park gate. 

Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, 
square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all 
owned by large, square owners who drove very clean 
cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred Little 
Whinging by night, when the curtained windows 
made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness 
and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving 
mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he 
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that 
halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into 
view again; they were saying their farewells at the 
entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into 
the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.

""... squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was 
saying, to guffaws from the others. 

“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers. 

“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley. 

“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said 
Gordon. 

“See you then,” said Dudley. 

“Bye Dud!” 

“See ya, Big D!” 

Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on 
before setting off again. When their voices had faded 
once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia 
Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came 
within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling 
along at his ease, humming tunelessly. 

“Hey, Big D!” 

Dudley turned. 

“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.” 

“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry. 

“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again. 

“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into 
step beside his cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle 
Diddykins to me.” 

“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands 
had curled into fists. 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls 
you?” 

“Shut your face.” 

“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about 
‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them 
then?” 

Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself 
from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his 
self-control. 

“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry 
asked, his grin fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know 
you did Mark Evans two nights ago — ” 

“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley. 

“Oh yeah?” 

“He cheeked me.” 

“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been 
taught to walk on its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not 
cheek, Dud, that’s true ...” 

A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry 
enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was 
making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning 
off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet 
he had. 

They turned right down the narrow alleyway where 
Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a 
shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria 
Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets 
it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their 



Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one 
side and a high fence on the other. 

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t 
you?” Dudley said after a few seconds. 

“What thing?” 

“That — that thing you’re hiding.” 

Harry grinned again. 

“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose 
if you were, you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at 
the same time...” 

Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look 
sideways at it. 

“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know 
you’re not. You’d get expelled from that freak school 
you go to.” 

“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big 
D?” 

“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound 
completely convinced. Harry laughed softly. 

“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that 
thing, have you?” Dudley snarled. 

“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before 
you can beat up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing 
title you keep banging on about? How old was your 
opponent? Seven? Eight?” 

“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled 
Dudley, “and he was out cold for twenty minutes after 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




I’d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as 
you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing 
out — ” 

“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing 
champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?” 

“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley. 

“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when 
it goes all dark like this.” 

“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled. 

He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at 
his cousin. From the little he could see of Dudley’s 
large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant 
look. 

“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, 
completely nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be 
frightened of pillows or something?” 

“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. 
“Talking in your sleep. Moaning.” 

“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was 
a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had 
revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams. 

Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a 
high-pitched, whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! 
Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric — your boyfriend?” 

“I — you’re lying — ” said Harry automatically. But his 
mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — 
how else would he know about Cedric? 



Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ T)ad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo- 
hoo!”’ 

“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m 
warning you!” 

“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! 
He’s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to — ’ 
Don’t you point that thing at me\” 

Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing 
the wand directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel 
fourteen years’ hatred of Dudley pounding in his 
veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, to jinx 
Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an 
insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers — 

“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. 
“D’you understand me?” 

“Point that thing somewhere else!” 

“I said, do you understand me?” 

“Point it somewhere else\” 

“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?” 

“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM — ” 

Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he 
had been doused in icy water. 

Something had happened to the night. The star- 
strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and 
lightless — the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps 
at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant 
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. 

The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly 
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, 
silent darkness, as though some giant hand had 
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, 
blinding them. 

For a split second Harry thought he had done magic 
without meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been 
resisting as hard as he could — then his reason 
caught up with his senses — he didn’t have the power 
to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and 
that, trying to see something, but the darkness 
pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil. 

Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear. 

“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!” 

“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!” 

“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I — ” 

“I said shut up!” 

Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left 
and right. The cold was so intense that he was 
shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his 
arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were 
standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest 
extent, staring blankly around, unseeing . . . 

It was impossible... They couldn’t be here... Not in 
Little Whinging ... He strained his ears... He would 
hear them before he saw them... 

“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? 
What are you d-do — ?” 

“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis — ” 



Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had 
been dreading. 



There was something in the alleyway apart from 
themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, 
rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as 
he stood trembling in the freezing air. 

“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! Ill h-hit you, I swear I 
will!” 

“Dudley, shut — ” 

WHAM 

A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, 
lifting Harry off his feet. Small white lights popped in 
front of Harry’s eyes; for the second time in an hour 
he felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; 
next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and 
his wand had flown out of his hand. 

“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering 
with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees, 
now feeling around frantically in the blackness. He 
heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, 
stumbling. 

“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT 
AT IT!” 

There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s 
footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a 
creeping chill behind him that could mean only one 
thing. There was more than one. 

“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER 
YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry 

Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground 
like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on — Lumosl” 

He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to 
help him in his search — and to his disbelieving 
relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the 
wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, 
scrambled to his feet, and turned around. 

His stomach turned over. 

A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly 
toward him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face 
visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it 
came. 

Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand. 

“Expecto Patronurrd” 

A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand 
and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked 
properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated 
farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic 
fogging his brain — concentrate — 

A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside 
the dementor’s robes, reaching for him. A rushing 
noise filled Harry’s ears. 

“Expecto PatronumV’ 

His voice sounded dim and distant... Another wisp of 
silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the 
wand — he couldn’t do it anymore, he couldn’t work 
the spell "

Harry Potter - THE OTHER MINISTER	",

THE OTHER MINISTER ,
,
It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was ,
"sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that ",
was slipping through his brain without leaving the ,
slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for ,
"a call from the President of a far distant country, and ",
between wondering when the wretched man would ,
"telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant ",
"memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and ",
"difficult week, there was not much space in his head ",
for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on ,
"the print on the page before him, the more clearly the ",
Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of ,
his political opponents. This particular opponent had ,
"appeared on the news that very day, not only to ",
enumerate all the terrible things that had happened ,
in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) ,
but also to explain why each and every one of them ,
was the government’s fault. ,
,
The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very ,
"thought of these accusations, for they were neither ",
fair nor true. How on earth was his government ,
,
Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It ,
was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were ,
not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was ,
"fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at ",
"a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, ",
sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the ,
river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was ,
lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very ,
nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the ,
government should have somehow foreseen the freak ,
hurricane in the West Country that had caused so ,
much damage to both people and property? And was ,
"it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert ",
"Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly ",
that he was now going to be spending a lot more time ,
with his family? ,
,
"“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent ",
"had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin. ",
,
"And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime ",
Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more ,
miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; ,
all this chilly mist in the middle of July. ... It wasn’t ,
"right, it wasn’t normal. ... ",
,
"He turned over the second page of the memo, saw ",
"how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad ",
job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked ,
around his office mournfully. It was a handsome ,
"room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash ",
"windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable ",
"chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up ",
"and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin ",
mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was ,
"then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he ",
heard a soft cough behind him. ,
,
,
,
Page | 3 ,
,
,
,
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking ",
reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He ,
had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the ,
empty room. ,
,
"“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt. ",
,
For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible ,
"hope that nobody would answer him. However, a ",
"voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that ",
sounded as though it were reading a prepared ,
statement. It was coming — as the Prime Minister ,
had known at the first cough — from the froglike little ,
man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a ,
"small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room. ",
,
“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. ,
"Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.” ",
,
The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the ,
Prime Minister. ,
,
"“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. ... It’s not a very ",
"good time for me. ... I’m waiting for a telephone call, ",
you see . . . from the President of — ” ,
,
"“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. ",
The Prime Minister’s heart sank. He had been afraid ,
of that. ,
,
“But I really was rather hoping to speak — ” ,
,
“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. ,
,
"He will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the ",
little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. ,
,
Fudge.” ,
,
"“I ... oh ... very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. ",
"“Yes, I’ll see Fudge.” ",
,
Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as ",
"he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and ",
arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed ,
"and unfazed expression, when bright green flames ",
burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble ,
"mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker ",
"of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within ",
"the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, ",
"he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, ",
brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped ,
"cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand. ",
,
"“Ah ... Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding ",
forward with his hand outstretched. “Good to see you ,
again.” ,
,
The Prime Minister could not honestly return this ,
"compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not ",
"remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional ",
"appearances, apart from being downright alarming in ",
"themselves, generally meant that he was about to ",
"hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was ",
"looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, ",
"and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The ",
Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in ,
"politicians before, and it never boded well. ",
,
"“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand ",
very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the ,
chairs in front of the desk. ,
,
"“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, ",
"pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his ",
"green bowler upon his knees. “What a week, what a ",
week ...” ,
,
"“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime ",
"Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had ",
,
,
,
Page | 5 ,
,
,
,
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
quite enough on his plate already without any extra ,
helpings from Fudge. ,
,
,
,
"“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily ",
and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been ,
"having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The ",
Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... ,
not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...” ,
,
"“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your ",
"people were — were involved in those — those things, ",
were they?” ,
,
Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern ,
"look. “Of course they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve ",
realized what’s going on?” ,
,
“I ...” hesitated the Prime Minister. ,
,
It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him ,
"dislike Fudge’s visits so much. He was, after all, the ",
Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to ,
"feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had ",
been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge ,
on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He ,
remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew ,
it would haunt him until his dying day. ,
,
"He had been standing alone in this very office, ",
savoring the triumph that was his after so many ,
"years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard ",
"a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to ",
"find that ugly little portrait talking to him, ",
announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to ,
arrive and introduce himself. ,
,
"Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and ",
the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. ,
He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking ,
,
Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt ",
when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the ,
fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained ,
speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation ,
that there were witches and wizards still living in ,
secret all over the world and his reassurances that he ,
was not to bother his head about them as the ,
Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole ,
Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical ,
"population from getting wind of them. It was, said ",
"Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything ",
from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to ,
keeping the dragon population under control (the ,
Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for ,
support at this point). Fudge had then patted the ,
shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a ,
fatherly sort of way. ,
,
"“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never ",
see me again. I’ll only bother you if there’s something ,
"really serious going on our end, something that’s ",
likely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical ,
"population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let ",
"live. And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than ",
your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the ,
"window, thought I was a hoax planned by the ",
opposition.” ,
,
"At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. ",
"“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?” ",
,
"It had been his last, desperate hope. ",
,
"“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.” ",
,
And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a ,
gerbil. ,
,
,
,
Page | 7 ,
,
,
,
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching ",
"his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, ",
“but why — why has nobody told me — ?” ,
,
“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to ,
"the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, ",
poking his wand back inside his jacket. “We find it ,
the best way to maintain secrecy.” ,
,
"“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a ",
former Prime Minister warned me — ?” ,
,
"At this, Fudge had actually laughed. ",
,
"“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell ",
anybody?” ,
,
"Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into ",
"the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and ",
vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime ,
"Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and ",
"realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare ",
"mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the ",
wide world would believe him? ,
,
The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a ,
"time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had ",
indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of ,
sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain ,
attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this ,
"uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to ",
his delighted niece and instructed his private ,
secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little ,
man who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the ,
"Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had ",
proved impossible to remove. When several ,
"carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the ",
Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried ,
"unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime ",
Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply ,
resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless ,
and silent for the rest of his term in office. ,
Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the ,
corner of his eye the occupant of the painting ,
"yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or ",
"twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving ",
nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. ,
"However, he had trained himself not to look at the ",
"picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly ",
that his eyes were playing tricks on him when ,
anything like this happened. ,
,
"Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the ",
Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the ,
portrait had once again announced the imminent ,
"arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, ",
sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. ,
Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was ,
"dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ",
ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never ,
"heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something ",
"that sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry ",
"Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the ",
Prime Minister. ,
,
"... Fve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, ",
tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his ,
"bowler hat into his pocket. “Middle of the North Sea, ",
"you know, nasty flight . . . the dementors are in ",
uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had a ,
"breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime ",
Minister. Black’s a known Muggle killer and may be ,
"planning to rejoin You-Know-Who. ... But of course, ",
you don’t even know who You-Know-Who is!” He had ,
"gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, ",
"then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill you ",
in. ... Have a whiskey ...” ,

The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit ,
"down in his own office, let alone offered his own ",
"whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out ",
"his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber ",
"liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the ",
"Prime Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair. ",
,
Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one ,
"point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and ",
"wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he ",
had thrust into the Prime Minister’s whiskey-free ,
"hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the ",
Prime Minister had stood up too. ,
,
“So you think that ...” He had squinted down at the ,
name in his left hand. “Lord Vol — ” ,
,
“ He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\” snarled Fudge. ,
,
“I’m sorry. ... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be- ,
"Named is still alive, then?” ",
,
"“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had ",
"fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but ",
"we’ve never found him. If you ask me, he’s not ",
"dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s Black we ",
ought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that ,
"warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don’t see ",
"each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.” ",
,
But they had seen each other again. Less than a year ,
later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of ,
thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime ,
Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the ,
Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) ,
World Cup and that several Muggles had been ,
"“involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not to ",
"worry, the fact that You-Know- Who’s Mark had been ",
seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an ,
Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was ",
dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke. ,
,
"“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re ",
importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the ,
"Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the ",
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical ,
Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that ,
we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly ,
dangerous creatures into the country.” ,
,
“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister. ,
,
"“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good ",
day to you.” ,
,
The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that ,
"dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but ",
"no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out ",
"of the fire yet again, this time with the news that ",
there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban. ,
,
“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister ,
hoarsely. ,
,
"“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, ",
already with one foot in the flames. “We’ll have them ,
rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to ,
know!” ,
,
"And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait ",
just one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of ,
green sparks. ,
,
"Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the ",
Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not ,
"escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances ",
"at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a ",
"lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more ",
Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to ,
"think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always ",
"called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the ",
Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next ,
time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news ,
"still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the ",
"fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and ",
sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not ,
"know exactly why he was there, was about the worst ",
thing that had happened in the course of this ,
extremely gloomy week. ,
,
“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — ,
Wizarding community?” snapped the Prime Minister ,
now. “I have a country to run and quite enough ,
concerns at the moment without — ” ,
,
"“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. ",
,
“The Brockdale Bridge didn’t wear out. That wasn’t ,
really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work ,
of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s family would be ,
safer without him. We are currently making ,
arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo’s ,
Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move ,
should be effected tonight.” ,
,
“What do you ... I’m afraid I ... What?” blustered the ,
Prime Minister. ,
,
"Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime ",
"Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he’s ",
back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.” ,
,
“Back? When you say ‘back’ ... he’s alive? I mean — ” ,
,
The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the ,
details of that horrible conversation of three years ,
"previously, when Fudge had told him about the ",
"wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard ",
,
Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before ,
his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier. ,
,
"“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is ",
a man alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t really ,
"understand it, and Dumbledore won’t explain ",
"properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a body and ",
"is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for ",
"the purposes of our discussion, yes, he’s alive.” ",
,
"The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, ",
but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well- ,
informed on any subject that came up made him cast ,
around for any details he could remember of their ,
previous conversations. ,
,
“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be- ,
Named?” ,
,
"“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his ",
"bowler rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you ",
"mean? Merlin’s beard, no. Black’s dead. Turns out we ",
were — er — mistaken about Black. He was innocent ,
after all. And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must- ,
"Not-Be-Named either. I mean,” he added defensively, ",
"spinning the bowler hat still faster, “all the evidence ",
pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but ,
"anyway, as I say, he’s dead. Murdered, as a matter of ",
fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There’s going to ,
"be an inquiry, actually. ...” ",
,
"To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting ",
"stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, ",
eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at ,
"the thought that, deficient though he himself might ",
"be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there ",
had never been a murder in any of the government ,
"departments under his charge. ... Not yet, anyway ... ",
,
,
,
Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the ,
"wood of his desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by- ",
"the-by now. The point is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, ",
and steps must be taken.” ,
,
“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. ,
“Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?” ,
,
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by ,
those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in ,
"January,” said Fudge, speaking more and more ",
rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a ,
lime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the ,
"open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale ",
"Bridge — he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a ",
mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and ,
,
,
,
"“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed ",
and I’m having to answer questions about rusted ,
rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don’t ,
know what else!” said the Prime Minister furiously. ,
,
"“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying ",
you would have caved in to blackmail like that?” ,
,
"“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up ",
"and striding about the room, “but I would have put all ",
my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he ,
committed any such atrocity!” ,
,
“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every ,
effort?” demanded Fudge heatedly. “Every Auror in ,
the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and ,
"round up his followers, but we happen to be talking ",
"about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a ",
wizard who has eluded capture for almost three ,
decades!” ,
,
,
,

,
,
,
,
“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the ,
hurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime ,
"Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It ",
was infuriating to discover the reason for all these ,
"terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, ",
almost worse than it being the government’s fault ,
after all. ,
,
"“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably. ",
,
"“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now ",
"positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, ",
"roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries — ” ",
,
"“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must- ",
Not-Be-Named’s followers. And ... and we suspect ,
giant involvement.” ,
,
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though ,
he had hit an invisible wall. “ What involvement?” ,
,
"Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he ",
"wanted to go for the grand effect,” he said. “The Office ",
"of Misinformation has been working around the clock, ",
we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify ,
the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really ,
"happened, we’ve got most of the Department for the ",
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running ,
"around Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s ",
been a disaster.” ,
,
“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously. ,
,
“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the ,
"Ministry,” said Fudge. “What with all that, and then ",
losing Amelia Bones.” ,
,
“Losing who?” ,
,
,
,
Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical ,
Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- ,
"Named may have murdered her in person, because ",
she was a very gifted witch and — and all the ,
evidence was that she put up a real fight.” ,
,
"Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it ",
"seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat. ",
,
"“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the ",
"Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. ",
“Our newspapers. Amelia Bones ... it just said she ,
was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a — ,
"a nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of ",
"publicity. The police are baffled, you see.” ",
,
"Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. ",
"“Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, ",
"wasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who ",
"did it, not that that gets us any further toward ",
"catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, ",
maybe you didn’t hear about that one — ” ,
,
“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened ,
"just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. ",
"The papers had a field day with it, ‘breakdown of law ",
and order in the Prime Minister’s backyard — ’ ” ,
,
"“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely ",
"listening to the Prime Minister, “we’ve got dementors ",
"swarming all over the place, attacking people left, ",
"right, and center. ...” ",
,
Once upon a happier time this sentence would have ,
"been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was ",
wiser now. ,
,
“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in ,
"Azkaban,” he said cautiously. ",
,
Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. ",
They’ve deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must- ,
Not-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.” ,
,
"“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of ",
"dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the ",
creatures that drain hope and happiness out of ,
people?” ,
,
“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s ,
causing all this mist.” ,
,
"The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the ",
nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping ,
"through the towns and countryside, spreading ",
"despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel ",
quite faint. ,
,
"“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! ",
It’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!” ,
,
"“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m ",
still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked ,
three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has ,
been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve ,
never known them so united in my whole term of ,
"office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile. ",
,
The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. ,
Despite his indignation at the position into which he ,
"had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken- ",
looking man sitting opposite him. ,
,
"“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I ",
can do?” ,
,
"“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is ",
nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to ,
date on recent events and to introduce you to my ,
,
Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but ",
"of course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so ",
much going on.” ,
,
Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little ,
"man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was ",
digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching ,
"Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a ",
"moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.” ",
,
"“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the ",
first time. “I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a ,
"day for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge. If he’d ",
"just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still ",
"be ... Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more ",
success.” ,
,
Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved ,
"silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the ",
"portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official ",
voice. ,
,
“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a ,
meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus ,
"Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.” ",
,
"“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, ",
and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate ,
"turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a ",
"second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him ",
moments later onto the antique rug. ,
,
"Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, ",
"the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new ",
"arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, ",
and look around. ,
,
"The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that ",
Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. ,
,
Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair ,
and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes ,
behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain ,
"rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a ",
slight limp. There was an immediate impression of ,
shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister ,
thought he understood why the Wizarding community ,
preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these ,
dangerous times. ,
,
"“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, ",
holding out his hand. ,
,
"Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the ",
"room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes. ",
,
"“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over ",
to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. ,
The Prime Minister heard the lock click. ,
,
"“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t ",
"mind, I’d rather that door remained unlocked.” ",
,
"“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour ",
"shortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his wand at ",
"the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. ",
"“Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to ",
"business. First of all, we need to discuss your ",
security.” ,
,
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest ,
"height and replied, “I am perfectly happy with the ",
"security I’ve already got, thank you very — ” ",
,
"“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor ",
lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets ,
put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in ,
your outer office — ” ,
,
,
,
Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
"‘Tm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s ",
what you’re suggesting!” said the Prime Minister ,
"hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the ",
work the rest of them — ” ,
,
"“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, ",
"without a flicker of a smile. “A highly trained Auror, ",
who has been assigned to you for your protection.” ,
,
"“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. ",
"“You can’t just put your people into my office, I decide ",
who works for me — ” ,
,
“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said ,
Scrimgeour coldly. ,
,
"“I am — that’s to say, I was — ” ",
,
"“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour. ",
,
"“I ... well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to ",
"be ... er ... excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, ",
but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him. ,
,
"“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” ",
he continued. “The one who has been entertaining the ,
public by impersonating a duck.” ,
,
“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister. ,
,
“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed ,
"Imperius Curse,” said Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his ",
"brains, but he could still be dangerous.” ",
,
“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. ,
“Surely a bit of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink ,
,
,
,
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling ,
,
,
,
,
“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for ,
Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as ,
we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of ,
"them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it best that we ",
remove him from Muggle society for a while.” ,
,
"“I ... well ... He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the ",
Prime Minister anxiously. ,
,
"Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back ",
toward the fireplace. ,
,
"“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you ",
"posted of developments, Prime Minister — or, at least, ",
"I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in ",
which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented ,
to stay on in an advisory capacity.” ,
,
"Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he ",
merely looked as though he had a toothache. ,
Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for ,
the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The ,
Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them ,
"for a moment, then the words he had fought to ",
suppress all evening burst from him at last. ,
,
“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards'. You can do ,
magic ! Surely you can sort out — well — anything !” ,
,
Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged ,
"an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did ",
"manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The ",
"trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime ",
Minister.” ,
,
"And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the ",
other into the bright green fire and vanished. ,

SPINNER’S END ,
,
Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed ,
against the Prime Minister’s windows drifted over a ,
"dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish- ",
"strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a ",
"disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There ",
was no sound apart from the whisper of the black ,
water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that ,
had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some ,
old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass. ,
,
"But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure ",
appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The ,
"fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new ",
phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings ,
"for a few moments, then set off with light, quick ",
"strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass. ",
,
"With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure ",
materialized. ,
,
“Wait!” ,

Harry Potter - THE DARK LORD ASCENDING,"I 



* 

THE DARK LORD ASCENDING 

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards 
apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they 
stood quite still, wands directed at each other’s 
chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed 
their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking 
briskly in the same direction. 

“News?” asked the taller of the two. 

“The best,” replied Severus Snape. 

The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low- 
growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly 
manicured hedge. The men’s long cloaks flapped 
around their ankles as they marched. 

“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt 
features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of 
overhanging trees broke the moonlight. “It was a little 
trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be 
satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will 
be good?” 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned 
right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The 
high hedge curved with them, running off into the 
distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron 
gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke 
step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of 
salute and passed straight through, as though the 
dark metal were smoke. 

The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s 
footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their 
right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his 
companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved 
to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, 
strutting majestically along the top of the hedge. 

“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks ...” 
Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a 
snort. 

A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at 
the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the 
diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in 
the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was 
playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape 
and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung 
inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly 
opened it. 

The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously 
decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of 
the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on 
the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode 
past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door 
leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of 
a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle. 

The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a 
long and ornate table. The room’s usual furniture had 

Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




been pushed carelessly up against the walls. 
Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a 
handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a 
gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a 
moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew 
accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn 
upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an 
apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside 
down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended 
by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in 
the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of 
the people seated underneath this singular sight was 
looking at it except for a pale young man sitting 
almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent 
himself from glancing upward every minute or so. 

“Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head 
of the table. “You are very nearly late.” 

The speaker was seated directly in front of the 
fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new 
arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they 
drew nearer, however, his face shone through the 
gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and 
gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was 
so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow. 

“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat 
on his immediate right. “Yaxley — beside Dolohov.” 

The two men took their allotted places. Most of the 
eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to 
him that Voldemort spoke first. 

“So?” 

“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move 
Harry Potter from his current place of safety on 
Saturday next, at nightfall.” 

Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The interest around the table sharpened palpably: 
Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape 
and Voldemort. 

“Saturday ... at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His 
red eyes fastened upon Snape ’s black ones with such 
intensity that some of the watchers looked away, 
apparently fearful that they themselves would be 
scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, 
looked calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a 
moment or two, Voldemort’s lipless mouth curved into 
something like a smile. 

“Good. Very good. And this information comes — ” 

“ — from the source we discussed,” said Snape. 

“My Lord.” 

Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table 
at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him. 

“My Lord, I have heard differently.” 

Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he 
went on, “Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will 
not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the 
boy turns seventeen.” 

Snape was smiling. 

“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false 
trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm 
has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the 
first time; he is known to be susceptible.” 

“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite 
certain,” said Yaxley. 



Page | 5 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” 
said Snape. “I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office 
will play no further part in the protection of Harry 
Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the 
Ministry.” 

“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a 
squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he 
gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there 
along the table. 

Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered 
upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he 
seemed to be lost in thought. 

“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an 
entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy 



Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley 
subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort 
turned back to Snape. 

“Where are they going to hide the boy next?” 

“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The 
place, according to the source, has been given every 
protection that the Order and Ministry together could 
provide. I think that there is little chance of taking 
him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the 
Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might 
give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough 
of the enchantments to break through the rest.” 

“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the 
firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the 
Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?” 



Page | 6 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his 
shoulders. 

“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have — 
with difficulty, and after great effort — suceeded in 
placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.” 

Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked 
impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, 
twisted face, clapped him on the back. 

“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only 
one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our 
people before I act. One failed attempt on the 
Minister’s life will set me back a long way.” 

“Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as 
Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, 
Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the 
Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the 
other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy 
now that we have such a high-ranking official under 
our control, to subjugate the others, and then they 
can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.” 

“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered 
before he has converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At 
any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be 
mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the 
boy at his destination, then it must be done while he 
travels.” 

“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, 
who seemed determined to receive some portion of 
approval. “We now have several people planted within 
the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter 
Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know 
immediately.” 



Page | 7 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is 
eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or 
regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to 
do with the place.” 

“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move 
in the open. Easier to take, by far.” 

Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving 
body as he went on, “I shall attend to the boy in 
person. There have been too many mistakes where 
Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been 
my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors 
than to his triumphs.” 

The company around the table watched Voldemort 
apprehensively, each of them, by his or her 
expression, afraid that they might be blamed for 
Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, 
however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than 
to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body 
above him. 

“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by 
luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best- 
laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those 
things that I did not understand before. I must be the 
one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.” 

At these words, seemingly in response to them, a 
sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of 
misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked 
downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to 
issue from below their feet. 

“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his 
quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes 
from the revolving body above, “have I not spoken to 
you about keeping our prisoner quiet?” 

Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down 
the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair 
that it had appeared, at first glance, to be 
unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and 
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him 
but a curious gleam of silver. 

“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again 
at the tense faces of his followers, “I understand 
better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a 
wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.” 

The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; 
he might have announced that he wanted to borrow 
one of their arms. 

“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see ... Lucius, 
I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.” 

Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish 
and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken 
and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. 

“My Lord?” 

“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.” 



Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring 
straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long 
blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the 
table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At 
her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, 
withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, 
who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it 
closely. 

“What is it?” 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy. 



“And the core?” 

“Dragon — dragon heartstring.” 

“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand 
and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an 
involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it 
seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s wand in 
exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by 
Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously. 

“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?” 

Some of the throng sniggered. 

“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not 
enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your 
family seem less than happy of late. ... What is it 
about my presence in your home that displeases you, 
Lucius?” 

“Nothing — nothing, my Lord!” 

“Such lies, Lucius ...” 

The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel 
mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards 
barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew 
louder; something heavy could be heard sliding 
across the floor beneath the table. 

The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up 
Voldemort’s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, and 
came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck 
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their 
vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked 

Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




the creature absently with long thin fingers, still 
looking at Lucius Malfoy. 

“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? 

Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they 
professed to desire for so many years?” 

“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand 
shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did 
desire it — we do.” 

To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her 
eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his 
right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the 
inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort 
and away again, terrified to make eye contact. 

“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the 
table, her voice constricted with emotion, “it is an 
honor to have you here, in our family’s house. There 
can be no higher pleasure.” 

She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with 
her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in 
bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and 
impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for 
mere words could not demonstrate her longing for 
closeness. 

“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head 
tilted a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. 
“That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.” 

Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears 
of delight. 

“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!” 



Page | 11 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy 
event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this 
week?” 



She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. 

“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.” 

“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, 
Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married the 
werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.” 

There was an eruption of jeering laughter from 
around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange 
gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. 
The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its 
mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters 
did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and 
the Malfoys’ humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently 
flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy 
red. 

“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the 
outpouring of mirth. “We — Narcissa and I — have 
never set eyes on our sister since she married the 
Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of 
us, nor any beast she marries.” 

“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though 
his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the 
catcalls and jeers. “Will you babysit the cubs?” 

The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at 
his father, who was staring down into his own lap, 
then caught his mother’s eye. She shook her head 
almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan 
stare at the opposite wall. 



Page | 12 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. 
“Enough.” 

And the laughter died at once. 

“Many of our oldest family trees become a little 
diseased over time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, 
breathless and imploring. “You must prune yours, 
must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those 
parts that threaten the health of the rest.” 

“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes 
swam with tears of gratitude again. “At the first 
chance!” 

“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your 
family, so in the world . . . we shall cut away the 
canker that infects us until only those of the true 
blood remain. ...” 

Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it 
directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over 
the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to 
life with a groan and began to struggle against 
invisible bonds. 

“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked 
Voldemort. 

Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of 
the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, 
as though they had been given permission to show 
curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the 
woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, “Severus! 
Help me!” 

“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly 
away again. 



Page | 13 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the 
snake’s snout with his wand-free hand. Draco shook 
his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he 
seemed unable to look at her anymore. 

“But you would not have taken her classes,” said 
Voldemort. “For those of you who do not know, we are 
joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until 
recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry.” 

There were small noises of comprehension around the 
table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth 
cackled. 

“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of 
witches and wizards all about Muggles . . . how they 
are not so different from us ...” 

One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity 
Burbage revolved to face Snape again. 

“Severus ... please ... please ...” 

“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of 
Malfoy’s wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. 

“Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds 
of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage 
wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the 
Daily Prophet Wizards, she says, must accept these 
thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling 
of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most 
desirable circumstance. ... She would have us all 
mate with Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves. ...” 

Nobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking 
the anger and contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the 
third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. 
Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape 

Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 




looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned 
slowly away from him again. 

“Avada Kedavra.” 

The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the 
room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the 
table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of 
the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell 
out of his onto the floor. 

“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great 
snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto 
the polished wood.

IN MEMORIAM 

Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his 
left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered 
open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of 
breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea 
that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom 
door. 

“What the — ?” 

He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet 
Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was 
Dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his 
bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments 
of cup together with the other hand and threw them 
into the already crammed bin just visible inside his 
bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the 
bathroom to run his finger under the tap. 

It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that 
he still had four days left of being unable to perform 
magic . . . but he had to admit to himself that this 
jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -J.K. Rowling 



had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he 
came to think of it — particularly in light of his 
immediate plans — this seemed a serious flaw in his 
magical education. Making a mental note to ask 
Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of 
toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, 
before returning to his bedroom and slamming the 
door behind him. 

Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his 
school trunk for the first time since he had packed it 
six years ago. At the start of the intervening school 
years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three 
quarters of the contents and replaced or updated 
them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom 
— old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that 
no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged 
his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain 
in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn 
it to see a lot of blood. 

He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling 
down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the 
bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that 
flickered feebly between Support CEDRIC DIGGORY 
and POTTER STINKS , a cracked and worn-out 
Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note 
signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered 
the sharp edge that had done the damage. He 
recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment 
of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, 
Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt 
cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing 
more remained of his godfather’s last gift except 
powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of 
debris like glittering grit. 

Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which 
he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright 

Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the 
fragment on top of that morning’s Daily Prophet, 
which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem 
the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of 
regret and of longing the discovery of the broken 
mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the 
rubbish in the trunk. 

It took another hour to empty it completely, throw 
away the useless items, and sort the remainder in 
piles according to whether or not he would need them 
from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, 
cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his 
textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He 
wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with 
them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if 
they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His 
Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, 
certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once 
given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been 
repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were 
the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the note 
signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this 
place of honor not because it was valuable — in all 
usual senses it was worthless — but because of what 
it had cost to attain it. 

This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his 
desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of 
the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this 
summer. 

He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to 
his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to 
flick through the newspapers, throwing them onto the 
rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else 
faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited 
amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the 
moment. 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, 
Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue 
that he knew had arrived shortly after he had 
returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he 
remembered that there had been a small mention on 
the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, 
the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he 
found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk 
chair and reread the article he had been looking for. 

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED 

by Elphias Doge 

I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our 
first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was 
undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt 
ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon 
pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was 
no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and 
greenish hue did not encourage many to approach 
me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts 
under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a 
year previously, his father, Percival, had been 
convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon 
three young Muggles. 

Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who 
was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on 
the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he 
assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. 
Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad 
business, though many attempted to make him do so. 
Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father’s 
action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle- 
hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As 
anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never 
revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, 



Page | 19 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




his determined support for Muggle rights gained him 
many enemies in subsequent years. 

In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame 
had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of 
his first year he would never again be known as the 
son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less 
than the most brilliant student ever seen at the 
school. Those of us who were privileged to be his 
friends benefited from his example, not to mention his 
help and encouragement, with which he was always 
generous. He confessed to me in later life that he 
knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in 
teaching. 

He not only won every prize of note that the school 
offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with 
the most notable magical names of the day, including 
Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist ; Bathilda 
Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, 
the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found 
their way into learned publications such as 
Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and 
The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s future career 
seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question 
that remained was when he would become Minister of 
Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that 
he was on the point of taking the job, however, he 
never had Ministerial ambitions. 

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus’s 
brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not 
alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, 
preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than 
through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite 
wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers 
were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as 
two such different boys could do. In fairness to 
Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus’s 
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable 
experience. Being continually outshone was an 
occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot 
have been any more pleasurable as a brother. 

When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take 
the then- traditional tour of the world together, visiting 
and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our 
separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the 
very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother, Kendra, died, 
leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the 
family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay 
my respects at Kendra’s funeral, then left for what 
was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger 
brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to 
them, there could no longer be any question of Albus 
accompanying me. 

That was the period of our lives when we had least 
contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps 
insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow 
escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments 
of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of 
his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly 
dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own 
experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward 
the end of my year’s travels, that yet another tragedy 
had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, 
Ariana. 

Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long 
time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their 
mother, had a profound effect on both of her 
brothers. All those closest to Albus — and I count 
myself one of that lucky number — agree that 
Ariana ’s death, and Albus’s feeling of personal 
responsibility for it (though, of course, he was 
guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore. 



Page | 21 



Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




I returned home to find a young man who had 
experienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus 
was more reserved than before, and much less light- 
hearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had 
led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and 
Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would 
lift — in later years they reestablished, if not a close 
relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, 
he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then 
on, and his friends learned not to mention them. 

Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following 
years. Dumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the 
store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery 
of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, will benefit 
generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed 
in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of 
the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel 
ever matched that between Dumbledore and 
Grindelwald in 1 945. Those who witnessed it have 
written of the terror and the awe they felt as they 
watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. 
Dumbledore’s triumph, and its consequences for the 
Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in 
magical history to match the introduction of the 
International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He- 
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could 
find something to value in anyone, however 
apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe 
that his early losses endowed him with great 
humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship 
more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing 
compared to the Wizarding world’s. That he was the 
most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts 
headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he 
lived: working always for the greater good and, to his 
last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small 
Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met 
him. 

Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the 
picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was 
wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered 
over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the 
impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, 
whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. 

He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but 
ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to 
recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never 
once had he imagined Dumbledore ’s childhood or 
youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as 
Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired 
and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was 
simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione 
or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. 

He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his 
past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent 
even, but after all, it had been common knowledge 
that Du"
