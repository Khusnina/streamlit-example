Title,Description
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Chapter I
You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back. The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better. After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in dead people. Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn’t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself. Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, “Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon she would say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don’t you try to behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good. Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together. Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed a spider. I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.

Chapter II
We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson’s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:
“Who dah?”
He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch. Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:
“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n. Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.”
So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn’t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn’t want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome. As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches. Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore. We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:
“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.”
Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:
“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ’bout him?”
“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.
“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen in these parts for a year or more.”
They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn’t be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson—they could kill her. Everybody said:
“Oh, she’ll do. That’s all right. Huck can come in.”
Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.
“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”
“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.
“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”
“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,” says Tom Sawyer. ""We ain’t burglars. That ain’t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”
“Must we always kill the people?”
“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”
“Ransomed? What’s that?”
“I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve seen it in books; and so of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”
“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”
“Why, blame it all, we’ve got to do it. Don’t I tell you it’s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books, and get things all muddled up?”
“Oh, that’s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to them?—that’s the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it is?”
“Well, I don’t know. But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they’re dead.”
“Now, that’s something like. That’ll answer. Why couldn’t you said that before? We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they’ll be, too—eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.”
“How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there’s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”
“A guard! Well, that is good. So somebody’s got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that’s foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?”
“Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t you?—that’s the idea. Don’t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn ’em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”
“All right. I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?”
“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.”
“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it. Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”
Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t want to be a robber any more. So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people. Ben Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home. I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired."
A Ghost of A Chance,"Chapter 1
They say there are blessings from Katrina. Mine was I lost my job. I gaze around at the lush breakfast area of The Monteleone Hotel in New Orleans, enjoying eggs Benedict, crisp bacon and the creamiest grits I’ve had in years and force myself not to laugh. Life is looking up, despite my lack of job security. All I have to do is get on a plane, make my assignment and my life will resemble this from now on. “More coffee, ma’am?” I glance up from my newspaper I wasn’t really reading and there’s a red-headed man wearing a uniform more typical of the 1920s standing beside my table. And he isn’t carrying a coffee pot. Startled, I shake my head. I’ve had my caffeine quota for the day, promising my doctor I would stop at two cups in the morning. Of course, I never promised anything about afternoons. After all, I am a journalist. “Very good ma’am.” He bows and quietly saunters out the cafe door. I’d say float but that’s absurd. “Who was that?” I ask the waitress when she arrives to refill my cup. Despite my promises, I let her. “Who was what, dawlin?” After months in Cajun Country, it feels great to hear a New Orleans accent again, people we label “Yats” because they usually begin a greeting with “Where y’at?” It’s more Brooklyn than Southern, slower and more friendly. Definitely not the Hollywood, Tennessee Williams drawl most people assume to find here sprouting from residents dressed in seersucker and white bucks. The Yat sends me a puzzled grin with a hand on her hip, the kind siblings bestow on one another. This is New Orleans. We’re all related so why not just act like family. “Are you all doing a costume brunch now?” I ask, adding, “I’m writing a story on the hotel.” Dolores — it was written on her name tag right above “Ask About Our Rebirth Specials” — isn’t impressed with my assignment. She grabs one of her purple and gold hoop earrings and pulls, her snide expression unfaltering. “Did Margaret put you up to this?” “Who’s Margaret?” Dolores huffs and walks away, leaving me to ponder what the hell that was all about. I check my watch. Two hours. I’m meeting Mary Jo, my old roommate from college who is now the PR director of The Monteleone, and then I’m on my way. She’s late, as always, but this will be one of those times I’m not going to hang around, even though she set up my complimentary night at the historic hotel in the hopes I would write a glowing story to help attract tourists back to New Orleans; it’s been months since Katrina and many people still think we’re under water. But today my first press trip as a travel writer awaits and I have a plane to catch. Finally, Mary Jo appears, wearing her usual navy blue A-skirt and matching button-up sweater, topped by a discreet strand of pearls and cream-colored headband. I almost laugh because she could have walked out of the LSU Delta Gamma house, but her coifed hair and perfect makeup make me feel self-conscious. She waves from the hostess desk and I attempt to straighten out my wrinkled blouse before she sits down. “What’d you think?” she says before even pulling out a chair. “Gorgeous as always.” I place a hand over my coffee cup as Dolores arrives, hovering her pot across the table like an alien spaceship and sending me a suspicious glance. “The customer service is exceptional, Mary Jo McConnell.” Hearing the name, Dolores jerks to get a better look at my table companion. Mary Jo is clueless, but Dolores suddenly resorts back to her cheerful self.  “Would you like some coffee, Miss Mary Jo?” “No thanks, Dolores. I’m just here to see how my travel writer friend’s stay is going.” Mary Jo pronounces my new profession like my family does, as if I’ve decided to become a ventriloquist or palm reader for an occupation. I’ve been writing travel stories for years, bringing in extra income to my well-paying newspaper job covering the school board and police beat in deep St. Bernard Parish for the New Orleans Post. The Post is the smaller city newspaper to the notable Times-Picayune. Note sarcasm here: the pay sucked, we were but a shadow to the Times-Pic and guess who’s up for a Pulitzer for their Katrina coverage? My twin Sebastian thought my day job would produce fodder for the Great American Novel I was to write and my dad called it “a decent job and I should be glad to have one.” I saw it as newspaper hell. But I dismiss Mary Jo’s obvious doubting of me making a living at freelance travel writing, instead catching how Dolores is now doubly scared because she’s finally figured out I may write about her. She starts fussing over me and I wonder if, as a travel writer, I will have this power over people from now on. Cool. Mary Jo shushes her away and I explain how my suite overlooking Royal Street delighted every sense (all true), the rooftop pool was heavenly (too crowded and noisy but the drinks helped make that go away), my massage the night before couldn’t have been better (again, no lie, although that poor woman got her money’s worth working on me) and two small children kept me up all night running down the hall. I left that last part out. Either the hotel’s haunted or there are parents here waking from a good night’s sleep that I want to throttle. Once we get awkward business out of the way and I assure her a story is forthcoming in Mais Yeah!, the southwest Louisiana weekly I now write travel for, we catch up on girlfriend news. Mary Jo shows off her enormous diamond and grabs my day planner to circle the date of her upcoming wedding. Branford J. Whitaker the third, otherwise known as “Brick” — I don’t inquire — heads up his father’s Carnival store, the kind that sells all that China-made crap thrown at Mardi Gras parades, those lovely beads, doubloons, trinkets and the like that everyone kills each other over and then stuffs into attics like Christmas decorations. “There’s so much money in Carnival,” Mary Jo informs me. “You wouldn’t believe how much those krewe members spend on throws.” She leans in close and whispers with a sly smile, “Thousands and thousands, which is great for the Whitaker family.” I really shouldn’t have blurted it out, but I had to stop the jealousy rising in my chest. As much as I love my new freedom and finally realizing my dream, I’m scared as hell at the lack of financial security and I’m trying hard not to remember that fact. “You did what?” Mary Jo asks me, which surprises me as much as TB’s reaction. “I don’t understand why this is such a surprise.” “Viola, you’re upset because of the disaster,” she says, patting my hand. “The loss of your house, “It’s a mother-in-law unit,” I answer way too defensively. My mother calls my home in the neighboring town of Lafayette a potting shed because of its ruggedness — okay, it’s a bit frayed at the edges — and refuses to set foot inside. Which turned out to be a good thing; my parents never visit. “Deliah said it was a dump.” “You talked to my mother?” “I can find you a really nice place in New Orleans....” “Can’t afford it now that I’ve gone freelance. You talked to my mother?” Mary Jo takes my hand and squeezes. “We’re worried about you.” I pull my hand back and offer up my best “life is good, what hurricane?” smile. Nothing is taking me down today. “My landlord is letting me live there free in exchange for keeping an eye on the big house,” I say, trying to eliminate the defensive edge from my voice. It could have been a closet and I would have eagerly agreed. Well, it kinda is. “It’s part of the freedom package that’s allowing me to work as a travel writer and not go back to that horrid newsroom,” I continue. “You know how miserable I was.” Mary Jo tilts her head as if to start a “Yes, but....” “Did I tell you that Reece, my Cajun landlord, isn’t hard on the eyes?” Wrong thing to say when you’re fresh into a separation. “This is all too soon to be thinking of dating your landlord, Vi.” “Who said dating? He’s married.” Mary Jo winces. “Maybe you and TB should get counseling.” “You never liked TB,” I add. “Since when are you taking his side?” TB stands for T-Bubba. My ex loves to joke about his name, calling himself half Cajun, half redneck since the Cajun “T” stands for “petite,” or “Petite (Little) Bubba.” His father, the redneck half, was Bubba Senior. My mom calls TB a disease. Mary Jo huffs while shaking a packet of Sweet-n-Low before ripping off the side and pouring the cancerous substance into her coffee. Just watching her sip that pink stuff leaves an awful aftertaste in my mind and I swallow hard. “A divorce is a pretty big step,” she says. “And you just went through a traumatic experience. You don’t need to pile more stress on your life.” What’s a little more stress after axing your way through an attic when lake waters rushed through your home, to sit on a rooftop for two days while your government ignored you? Not knowing where your twin brother was for more than a week. In fact, now that Sebastian is working as a temp in the restaurant industry and moving around the Deep South, I still don’t know. “I’ll be fine.” Weirdly enough, I actually believe that, feel infinitely better. The future is unstable but the possibilities are endless. Mary Jo doesn’t share in my excitement. The light behind her eyes disappear, replaced by a comatose stare she once exhibited when she thought Lampton “Scoop” Mallard over at the KA house was having an affair. Goosebumps run up my arm and panic fills my chest. “Is this about Lillye?” she asks quietly. Time to leave. I check my watch. “I need to go. My plane leaves at ten.” “Viola.” Mary Jo grabs my hand as I rise. “This is all so horrible. You lost everything and now you’re getting a divorce and living in someone’s potting shed.” I give her a kiss on the cheek, knowing she means well. I have my photos. Really, what else matters? “I’ll be fine,” I say. Mary Jo grins through the tears; she really is a good friend. I give her a tight hug and roll my pink and white polka dot luggage I nabbed at Goodwill to the Honda that TB had insisted I keep (he’s spending his share of the FEMA money on a pickup). I have to stop by the house and give TB the mail, since mail service in New Orleans is spotty at best. Our insurance check finally arrived, so I need to hand it off to TB before I fly out so he can continue renovations. I drive through the tourist-infested French Quarter amazed at how the lure of Bourbon Street keeps them coming no matter what. Good thing our founding fathers settled the heart of the city above sea level. You’d never know a disaster happened gazing out at the crowds strolling through the ancient quarter, giant drinks shaped like bombs in their hands, those tacky beads around their necks making the Whitakers rich, and silly grins produced when alcohol mixes with the freedom to be whoever you wish to be. The closer I get to Rampart, however, the more damage I spot, blue tarps on the roofs to keep the rain out, piles of mildewed sheetrock by the curb. I turn and head over to Canal and move toward the lakeside of town, an area called Mid-City where TB and I lived. The waterline is evident here, like a child extended his hand with a pen between his fingers, letting it mark up the sides of houses. The further west I travel, the higher the mark, like I’m slowly descending under water and into hell. In fact, I am. All that euphoria of staying at the elegant, historic Monteleone Hotel in the heart of the romantic French Quarter disappears and the horror of Katrina stares back at me everywhere. I swallow hard, fighting down the bile and panic as I gaze at the blocks upon blocks of water-logged homes and the empty shopping centers and dead traffic lights. One corner still sports an abandoned boat from the rescue days. A pack of dogs runs wild down Iberville Street. A billboard blown free of its tethers has landed in a housetop and I see a smiling woman enjoying coffee peeking out by the chimney. This is what Mary Jo and my mother want me to live in. I vow to hand TB his mail and haul ass to the airport. He must have heard me drive up for TB is halfway to the curb by the time I turn off the engine. I’m not happy to see him and that old guilt comes back with a rush. I could write a dissertation on why my marriage failed, but sum it up with one sentence: The man aggravates the hell out of me. For years I tried to hide it, put “a nice face on” as my mother would say, but the nastiness in my voice bubbles to the surface and pours out, sometimes in turrets. Before I’m able to grab the mail and lock up the car, TB’s staring at me over the hood. “Mary Jo called in tears, said she’s worried about you.”I groan, pushing the lock button on the door; I wasn’t able to afford one of those push-button kind you carry on a key chain. I even roll down my windows the old-fashioned way. “What could possibly be wrong?” I ask TB sarcastically, laughing. “She said you’re on your way somewhere.” I don’t feel like explaining to the world where I am and what I’m doing because family and friends keep trying to talk me out of it. And get counseling. Both of which I don’t intend to do. Even though TB’s motivation is to get me back into the marriage, I keep it simple. “I’m going on a press trip.” “Oh yeah, what for?” Here come the twenty questions. TB’s idea of a conversation is asking mundane questions, like a three-year-old following a parent around the house. “What are you doing?” “What’s your plans for today?” “What do you want to do for dinner?” “Was that the mail?” “I got invited to go somewhere, to do a travel story,” I tell him. “Where are you going?” I shouldn’t have blurted it out but my multi-tasking brain is busy focusing on getting to the sidewalk and not on the elderly man across the street staring. A shiver runs up my spine as I feel those cold black eyes upon me. “I’m heading to Eureka Springs, Arkansas.” “What for?” I pull TB through our front gate and head up toward the house, glancing back to see if the old man is still there. He is. And his gaze still bores holes into my back. “Who is that?” I whisper to TB. “Who is what?"" A normal person would have had trouble comprehending how TB could have missed this intense weirdo across the street, but TB is regularly clueless. I turn toward the house but pause at the porch and hand TB the mail.“Aren’t you coming in?” “Uh, no.” I had seen all I had wanted of our house about a month after Katrina, when they finally let residents into the parish to view what was left — if anything — of their homes. Weeks under water can do amazing things to a person’s belongings, like a stick of butter in the microwave left on high too long. I don’t want to step foot in that house again. TB marches up the steps. “Want to see what I’ve done with the kitchen? I painted the cabinets and found some nice granite pieces half price.” I’m not following. “Really? I need to get to the airport.” He nods but I can tell he wants to talk, try to convince me a legal separation isn’t the best route. Thankfully my trip to the courthouse last week sealed the deal. “Your mother said we need time.” My head snaps to attention. “What? You talked to my mother?” “For a woman who routinely left me places as a child because she was too busy practicing speeches for her TV appearances, I doubt she’s worried.” “You should give her a break,” TB says. “Tulane hasn’t asked her back.” I’m sorry my mother is out of a job, really, but whose side is she on? She hates TB, convinced I had married beneath me, which is probably true. Now, he’s her best friend? I nod at the mail in his hands. “The insurance check is on top.” “I finished the second floor. You’ll hardly recognize it.” “Uh, huh.” I turn back toward the street and the creepy old man has reappeared on the porch next door. I can’t get to my car, out of the Katrina zone and to the airport fast enough. “Don’t you want to even look?” “Nope.” I head to the front gate but I can tell TB is hot on my heels. “What are you doing again?” “I told you, a travel writing thing,” I shout out without turning around. I can’t bear seeing that man again, or pondering how a man his age moved so fast. “Like the ones I used to do on the side, although this one is an organized press trip.” “Where are you staying?” “The Crescent Hotel.” Crap. I feel like Homer Simpson after he says something truly stupid. Why did I just tell TB that? I make it to the driver’s side and gaze up at him over the hood. He stands there like a puppy dog wanting a bone. “Can I come?” Travel writers on press trips receive everything complimentary — accommodations, food, plane tickets. Guests are not allowed. Usually, the tourist bureaus foot the bill and they are not about to spend valuable dollars on people who won’t write about the place. I’ve heard about husbands or wives posing as photographers but that’s about the extent of it. TB had accompanied me once on a trip I arranged on my own, and I hated every minute. I wanted to explore, he wanted to drink and sit by the pool. I wanted to enjoy a nice meal and examine the place on my own, he blurted out to everyone that I was there on assignment so every member of the restaurant visited our table. The next time I arranged an excursion I conveniently planned it over a weekend during football season, knowing well TB wouldn’t give up valuable couch time. “No, you can’t come,” I tell him tersely. “I could stay in the room, not bother you....” “No.” “I could just hang by the pool....” I hate to do it but the look on TB’s face, the putrid smell of mildew and decay and that horrid man’s stare make me slip in my car and drive off without another word. I have a plane to catch and nothing is getting me down today, I practically yell inside my head. The guilt is eating me alive and it takes everything not to gaze in the rearview mirror. “Call your mom,” I hear TB shout out, as I turn the corner and head back to the interstate. I’m late getting to the airport, mainly because my mother called twice and I fumbled with my purse trying to silence the damn cell phone. The distraction made me miss my exit and I ended up circling Kenner needlessly. When I finally park, get through security and make it to my gate, I have minutes to spare. I drop my bag at my feet, fall into the chair and breathe deeply, startling the well-dressed man across from me whose right eyebrow raises without him looking up from his laptop. “Finally,” I say to no one and the man shifts in his chair. Am I bothering him? Doesn’t matter. I’m free of my ex-husband, my overbearing family, my well-meaning friends pushing psychoanalysis and the putrid wrath that was Katrina and on my way to a new adventure and career. And that’s when she started singing.

Chapter 2
A woman about my age, soaking wet, stands dripping in the aisle outside my gate, belting out You Are My Sunshine at the top of her lungs. She looks me straight in the eyes, water leaking off the ends of her stringy black hair, puddles appearing at her bare feet, and explains how I make her happy when skies are gray. I look around to see if anyone else is watching this woman sing the Louisiana state song written by a former governor, her arms outstretched for emphasis when she hits “You’ll never know, dear, how much I love you,” but no one seems to notice her. A mother and daughter play with an American Girl doll to my right, a businessman devours a biscuit and sausage to my left and Mr. Fancy Pants continues reading his laptop. Usually I ignore the crazies in New Orleans, too, especially in Louis Armstrong Airport where half of the tourists are glazed and hung over and the other still fresh and slobbering from a night on Bourbon Street. The ones arriving have that get-me-a-drink look and who knows what for a motive so their focus is elsewhere. But this woman is soaked head to toe, looking positively frightened or agitated or both and singing as if her life depends on it. I lean over to search the airport corridors and two cops are laughing over coffee around Gate Number Four. Esther Williams is still singing and neither one looks in her direction. Weird. The gate agents are busy sliding boarding passes into the machine and a security guard drives up in one of those pseudo golf carts but no one even glances in this poor lady’s direction. Just when I am about to get up and see if I can be of assistance, Mr. Fancy Pants across from me, his head still bent toward his laptop in engrossed concentration, lifts his right hand and snaps his fingers. One simple gesture, and the singing stops. The woman appears as if she’s been slapped, her eyes registering intense pain. She bows her head in failure and moves away, her feet leaving prints as she meanders down the aisle. I glance back at Fancy Pants, whose hand has returned to his side, his gaze never leaving the screen, until they call Zone Three. He closes his laptop and rises, never glancing in my direction, heading to the ticket agent as if nothing had happened. When I check back on the wet opera singer, she’s gone. Vanished. Maybe my family and friends are right, I think, wondering where I put that card Mary Jo gave me, the one for the counselor specializing in post traumatic stress disorder. But that woman was standing in the aisle in front of me, singing to the heavens. I know what I saw. And if I’m not totally nuts Mr. Fancy Pants heard her too. I’m so confused and, like a good journalist, totally curious, but it’s time to get on the plane and start my new career. I sneak one last look down the airport corridor, even check for footprints, shake my head and hand the gate attendant my boarding pass. Once aboard, I have other things to worry about. I end up lodged between an overweight man hogging the armrest and an elderly woman knitting. I practically wrap my elbows around my chest like a true crazy person and attempt to read my “S” book, something light and funny with cartoon women on the cover with words like “sassy,” “seductive” and “scandalizing” among the back cover’s description. S books make me happy, take me away from waterlines and levee breaches and I’m not going to apologize for it like most women I know and call it “trash.” Right now these books are better than Prosac. I’m so enraptured in the hunk who runs the town newspaper and his fight with the spirited yet intelligent heroine of the mayor’s office that we land in the Northwest Arkansas airport in no time at all, a good-sized facility in a rural area near Bentonville and Rogers, places most people have never heard of unless they work for Walmart. Bentonville was home to entrepreneur Sam Walton who started the multi-national chain and thus the town became the operational hub of the megastores. Because Walton insisted companies move to the area if they wanted to be part of his dream, and all these new businesses plus Walmart need transportation services, the lovely new airport was built. Too bad New Orleans never had such pull, I think, as I head down impeccable marble aisles toward the baggage claim. The Crescent City had long outgrown its airport and progressive politicians had suggested a larger international airport almost halfway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans with a light rail in between but the idea never took. As usual not enough money. Or forward thinking. Plus, there was that time after Katrina when the airport became a hospital and morgue so right now all everyone’s thinking about is getting it back to normal. I wasn’t going to think about New Orleans on this trip, or my flooded home, lack of a steady job and the fact that my electricity would get cut off if my FEMA check didn’t arrive soon. Tonight I would sleep between layers of multi-thread linens and indulge in fine cuisine while PR people drive me around, line up interviews and pay for everything. Only in America could writers straddling the poverty line be wined and dined at posh hotels and four-star restaurants in fun destinations. “It doesn’t get better than this,” I whisper to myself. Travel writing was my dream in college, a career I wanted to start the moment that journalism diploma hit my greedy little hands. But it’s not something you major in, interview for and start the next day. You could nab a similar position at a magazine or become a newspaper travel editor, and lord knows I tried getting on at Southern Living and the Times-Picayune travel section for years. Or you could do what I did and cover the cops beat in St. Bernard Parish for the New Orleans Post while writing travel on the side for the Sunday edition and a few other small magazines and newspapers. That’s how I met Henry Torrington Wallace. I had driven to Birmingham for a journalism conference and took some side trips to compile into a feature for the Martin Luther King Jr. birthday weekend. The travel piece garnered a Louisiana Press Award and Henry called to ask if I wanted to join his agency’s press trip to Nashville. I wasn’t able to accept free trips at the time — against newspaper policy — but I kept his card just in case. Needless to say, my cops job in St. Bernard Parish washed away, pun so very much intended. Good riddance. Once I got established in Lafayette, Henry was the first person I rang. “I’m freelancing now for the chain in southwest Louisiana and a few magazines,” I told him. “Got any trips in the Deep South?” Did he ever. I was in business before you can say, “Your hotel room is complimentary.” I grab my polka dot bag and do as instructed, travel to the baggage claim and look for signs from Henry’s PR agency, the Wallace Group. As expected, Henry is waiting at the bottom of the escalator, his arms full of press packets. He tilts his chin up at me and I smile, tingling with excitement. I can feel those silky-smooth sheets already, after which I will relax in a bathtub full of free upscale products. For not the first time I wonder if the other journalists — those working at travel writing longer than me or who live in equally nice residences — feel the same rush when they exit the plane knowing what’s coming. “How’ve you been, Viola?” Henry asks me after an obligatory hug. His agency hails from Tennessee, so he’s Southern to the core. He also pronounces my name correctly: VIE-O-LA. “I’m great, Henry.” If only he knew just how, staring down at a press kit announcing “Heaven in the Ozarks!” “Is this it?” He grabs the handle of the polka dot bag and heads toward the exit. “I always travel light,” I say apologetically. Do other journalists bring more? What’s funny is that practically everything I own is in that bag. You know I’m not kidding. “Am I the only pick-up?” As soon as I ask, I realize two other travel writers are waiting by the door, a dark-haired woman dressed in a Talbots-style outfit complete with high heels and several layers of gold necklaces, intent on text messaging on what looks like a Blackberry (I honestly don’t know, never had the money to buy one), and an older man in jeans and a Lacosse shirt scoping out the local newspaper container. I smooth down the designer linen shirt I found at Goodwill, sorry for my choice since traveling between those two armrest hogs has rendered it a massive wave of wrinkles. I also worry about my tried and true Converse sneakers my mother calls adolescent. These days, I don’t care what my mother calls my clothes but I’m self-conscious around these people. “Small news hole,” the tall guy says without looking up. I extend my hand. “Viola Valentine.” Tall guy ignores me. “I hate it when they put ads on the front page.” “Richard Cambry,” Henry explains, then nods his head toward texting queen. “And Irene Fisher.” “Nice to meet you,” I say, but only Irene responds, without looking up. Ah, a nice polite bunch. We make our way to the van, one Henry has rented for the trip, and the Friendlys deposit their bags at the back while Richard talks about his newspaper days and grabs the front seat. Irene sighs and mutters something under her breath. “Do you need help?” I ask Henry, who gives me a sweet “Are you kidding, get in the van” look. He opens my door and I do the obligatory Southern conversation, asking about his wife, his job and Henry gives me a quick roundup with a smile.“Don’t we have to be there by four,” Richard asks from inside the van. “I don’t know, just saying. It has four on the schedule.” Henry smiles politely as only PR people can do; it’s an amazing talent they own, being able to offer impeccable customer service in the presence of assholes. “Be right back,” Henry says and heads back inside the airport. You’d think plum assignments such as these would render people gracious and thankful, but there are jerks in the best of professions, and plenty of folks who need bibs and bottles. Now realize, we must have credentials and extensive work experiences to be asked on press trips, not to mention there is an art to this craft most people don’t understand. No, it’s not about writing what you did on vacation. But come on, folks. When someone’s paying the bill, lining up interviews and driving you around in a van where you don’t even have to wear a seatbelt, the least you can do is be polite and grateful. Leave your whining at home. I enter the van and park next to Irene, who finishes her text and looks up. “Irene Fisher,” she announces, holding out her hand. I skip the reminder that we’ve already met and shake her hand, but dear old Richard doesn’t miss a thing. “We had introductions in the airport, Irene. If you weren’t so busy on that cell phone….” Richard must be around sixty or seventy with a head full of white hair to back up that statement and he launches into a tirade about young people and cell phones, using a woman not paying attention while driving as an example. From the way he describes this female, I pick up chauvinistic sentiments, not to mention arrogance and conceit. I didn’t like him back at the newspaper. Now I really don’t. Irene tunes him out but he keeps shifting in his seat to look at me. Just for fun, I ask if he’s married. “Who knows?” he answers, leaving this balloon of a thought floating above us. As if synchronized, Irene and I gaze at each other and silently vote not to pop that bubble. The pause we offer makes Richard uncomfortable so he launches into a lengthy explanation, mostly about how difficult women are to live with and how his wife is at fault for everything. Irene begins texting again and I stare out the window, noticing how rural the surrounding area is, when who should saunter by but Mr. Fancy Pants. He pauses at the van door with his laptop and garment bag — do people use those anymore? — and leans his head in to greet us. It’s the first time I get a good look at his face, which is handsome with sleek, sculptured lines, a no-nonsense countenance although I detect a slyness lurking beneath. His salt and pepper hair is perfectly combed back, a bit of a white streak happening around one temple but this guy plays it up, embracing what I suspect is early middle age. His green-gray eyes match the whole ensemble, as if he did it on purpose. My gay-dar is beeping rapidly. “You all remember Carmine Kelsey,” Henry says, adding for me, “and this is Viola Valentine. The Arkansas trip is her first with us.”
Carmine looks me in the eye for the first time, albeit briefly, raising one eyebrow. The atmosphere feels uncomfortable. I’m not sure if it’s because everyone now knows I’m a newbie to this business or Carmine had witnessed the wet opera singer. I realize someone must move to the back row to accommodate Carmine, so I take the opportunity to break gaze, stumbling into the back, the pieces of my press packet flying all over the floor. “Nice to meet you too,” he says, which garners a laugh from Richard and Irene, and I immediately dislike the man. As I rearrange my belongings and attempt to tame my now horribly wrinkled shirt, Henry jumps in the front and off we go. Richard begins a long discourse on the state of travel writing today and Henry politely listens while Irene and Carmine take to their electronics. I want desperately to ask Carmine about the wet apparition in the airport, but on the flip side, from his haughty demeanor and sarcastic snide, I want to cross him off my list with the rest of the van’s occupants. Instead, I enjoy the rolling countryside of northwest Arkansas with the budding sycamore and maple trees, fields full of rolled hay and nonchalant cows and little rolling streams crossing the highway. We pass lovely farmhouses where people reside with all their belongings, photos carefully preserved in family albums."
Anais of Brightshire,""
A Princess of Mars,"CHAPTER I
On the Arizona Hills. I am a very old man; how old I do not know. Possibly I am a hundred, possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men, nor do I remember any childhood. So far as I can recollect I have always been a man, a man of about thirty. I appear today as I did forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection. I do not know why I should fear death, I who have died twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality. And because of this conviction I have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death. I cannot explain the phenomena; I can only set down here in the words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizona cave. I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate. Possibly the suggestions which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me. My name is John Carter; I am better known as Captain Jack Carter of Virginia. At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of several hundred thousand dollars (Confederate) and a captain’s commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed; the servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South. Masterless, penniless, and with my only means of livelihood, fighting, gone, I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold. I spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate officer, Captain James K. Powell of Richmond. We were extremely fortunate, for late in the winter of 1865, after many hardships and privations, we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured. Powell, who was a mining engineer by education, stated that we had uncovered over a million dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months. As our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us must return to civilization, purchase the necessary machinery and return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine. As Powell was familiar with the country, as well as with the mechanical requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to make the trip. It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector. On March 3, 1866, Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our burros, and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse, and started down the mountainside toward the valley, across which led the first stage of his journey. The morning of Powell’s departure was, like nearly all Arizona mornings, clear and beautiful; I could see him and his little pack animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley, and all during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau. My last sight of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of the range on the opposite side of the valley. Some half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals. I am not given to needless worrying, but the more I tried to convince myself that all was well with Powell, and that the dots I had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses, the less I was able to assure myself. Since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian, and we had, therefore, become careless in the extreme, and were wont to ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails, taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches. Powell, I knew, was well armed and, further, an experienced Indian fighter; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in the North, and I knew that his chances were small against a party of cunning trailing Apaches. Finally I could endure the suspense no longer, and, arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine, I strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse, started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning. As soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a canter and continued this, where the going permitted, until, close upon dusk, I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell. They were the tracks of unshod ponies, three of them, and the ponies had been galloping. I followed rapidly until, darkness shutting down, I was forced to await the rising of the moon, and given an opportunity to speculate on the question of the wisdom of my chase. Possibly I had conjured up impossible dangers, like some nervous old housewife, and when I should catch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains. However, I am not prone to sensitiveness, and the following of a sense of duty, wherever it may lead, has always been a kind of fetich with me throughout my life; which may account for the honors bestowed upon me by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings, in whose service my sword has been red many a time. About nine o’clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast walk, and in some places at a brisk trot until, about midnight, I reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp. I came upon the spot unexpectedly, finding it entirely deserted, with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp. I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen, for such I was now convinced they must be, continued after Powell with only a brief stop at the hole for water; and always at the same rate of speed as his. I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture, so I urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping against hope that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him. Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me. I knew that Powell would need me now if ever, and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and difficult mountain trail. I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds, when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small, open plateau near the summit of the pass. I had passed through a narrow, overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land, and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay. The little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees, and there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some object near the center of the camp. Their attention was so wholly riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me, and I easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and made my escape with perfect safety. The fact, however, that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me. I do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes, because, in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death, I cannot recall a single one where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many hours later. My mind is evidently so constituted that I am subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to tiresome mental processes. However that may be, I have never regretted that cowardice is not optional with me. In this instance I was, of course, positive that Powell was the center of attraction, but whether I thought or acted first I do not know, but within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of warriors, shooting rapidly, and whooping at the top of my lungs. Singlehanded, I could not have pursued better tactics, for the red men, convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars was upon them, turned and fled in every direction for their bows, arrows, and rifles. The view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with apprehension and with rage. Under the clear rays of the Arizona moon lay Powell, his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the braves. That he was already dead I could not but be convinced, and yet I would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apaches as quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death. Riding close to him I reached down from the saddle, and grasping his cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount. A backward glance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be more hazardous than to continue across the plateau, so, putting spurs to my poor beast, I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I could distinguish on the far side of the table land. The Indians had by this time discovered that I was alone and I was pursued with imprecations, arrows, and rifle balls. The fact that it is difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight, that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent, and that I was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various deadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows of the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized. My horse was traveling practically unguided as I knew that I had probably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass than he, and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the summit of the range and not to the pass which I had hoped would carry me to the valley and to safety. It is probable, however, that to this fact I owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which befell me during the following ten years. My first knowledge that I was on the wrong trail came when I heard the yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off to my left. I knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock formation at the edge of the plateau, to the right of which my horse had borne me and the body of Powell. I drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below and to my left, and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing around the point of a neighboring peak. I knew the Indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong trail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right direction as soon as they located my tracks. I had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff. The trail was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction I wished to go. The cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right, and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom of a rocky ravine. I had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn to the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave. The opening was about four feet in height and three to four feet wide, and at this opening the trail ended. It was now morning, and, with the customary lack of dawn which is a startling characteristic of Arizona, it had become daylight almost without warning. Dismounting, I laid Powell upon the ground, but the most painstaking examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life. I forced water from my canteen between his dead lips, bathed his face and rubbed his hands, working over him continuously for the better part of an hour in the face of the fact that I knew him to be dead. I was very fond of Powell; he was thoroughly a man in every respect; a polished southern gentleman; a staunch and true friend; and it was with a feeling of the deepest grief that I finally gave up my crude endeavors at resuscitation. Leaving Powell’s body where it lay on the ledge I crept into the cave to reconnoiter. I found a large chamber, possibly a hundred feet in diameter and thirty or forty feet in height; a smooth and well-worn floor, and many other evidences that the cave had, at some remote period, been inhabited. The back of the cave was so lost in dense shadow that I could not distinguish whether there were openings into other apartments or not. As I was continuing my examination I commenced to feel a pleasant drowsiness creeping over me which I attributed to the fatigue of my long and strenuous ride, and the reaction from the excitement of the fight and the pursuit. I felt comparatively safe in my present location as I knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave against an army. I soon became so drowsy that I could scarcely resist the strong desire to throw myself on the floor of the cave for a few moments’ rest, but I knew that this would never do, as it would mean certain death at the hands of my red friends, who might be upon me at any moment. With an effort I started toward the opening of the cave only to reel drunkenly against a side wall, and from there slip prone upon the floor.

CHAPTER II
The escape of the dead. A sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me, my muscles relaxed, and I was on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of approaching horses reached my ears. I attempted to spring to my feet but was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to my will. I was now thoroughly awake, but as unable to move a muscle as though turned to stone. It was then, for the first time, that I noticed a slight vapor filling the cave. It was extremely tenuous and only noticeable against the opening which led to daylight. There also came to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor, and I could only assume that I had been overcome by some poisonous gas, but why I should retain my mental faculties and yet be unable to move I could not fathom. I lay facing the opening of the cave and where I could see the short stretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliff around which the trail led. The noise of the approaching horses had ceased, and I judged the Indians were creeping stealthily upon me along the little ledge which led to my living tomb. I remember that I hoped they would make short work of me as I did not particularly relish the thought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spirit prompted them. I had not long to wait before a stealthy sound apprised me of their nearness, and then a war-bonneted, paint-streaked face was thrust cautiously around the shoulder of the cliff, and savage eyes looked into mine. That he could see me in the dim light of the cave I was sure for the early morning sun was falling full upon me through the opening. The fellow, instead of approaching, merely stood and stared; his eyes bulging and his jaw dropped. And then another savage face appeared, and a third and fourth and fifth, craning their necks over the shoulders of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow ledge. Each face was the picture of awe and fear, but for what reason I did not know, nor did I learn until ten years later. That there were still other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent from the fact that the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them. Suddenly a low but distinct moaning sound issued from the recesses of the cave behind me, and, as it reached the ears of the Indians, they turned and fled in terror, panic-stricken. So frantic were their efforts to escape from the unseen thing behind me that one of the braves was hurled headlong from the cliff to the rocks below. Their wild cries echoed in the canyon for a short time, and then all was still once more. The sound which had frightened them was not repeated, but it had been sufficient as it was to start me speculating on the possible horror which lurked in the shadows at my back. Fear is a relative term and so I can only measure my feelings at that time by what I had experienced in previous positions of danger and by those that I have passed through since; but I can say without shame that if the sensations I endured during the next few minutes were fear, then may God help the coward, for cowardice is of a surety its own punishment. To be held paralyzed, with one’s back toward some horrible and unknown danger from the very sound of which the ferocious Apache warriors turn in wild stampede, as a flock of sheep would madly flee from a pack of wolves, seems to me the last word in fearsome predicaments for a man who had ever been used to fighting for his life with all the energy of a powerful physique. Several times I thought I heard faint sounds behind me as of somebody moving cautiously, but eventually even these ceased, and I was left to the contemplation of my position without interruption. I could but vaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis, and my only hope lay in that it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me. Late in the afternoon my horse, which had been standing with dragging rein before the cave, started slowly down the trail, evidently in search of food and water, and I was left alone with my mysterious unknown companion and the dead body of my friend, which lay just within my range of vision upon the ledge where I had placed it in the early morning. From then until possibly midnight all was silence, the silence of the dead; then, suddenly, the awful moan of the morning broke upon my startled ears, and there came again from the black shadows the sound of a moving thing, and a faint rustling as of dead leaves. The shock to my already overstrained nervous system was terrible in the extreme, and with a superhuman effort I strove to break my awful bonds. It was an effort of the mind, of the will, of the nerves; not muscular, for I could not move even so much as my little finger, but none the less mighty for all that. And then something gave, there was a momentary feeling of nausea, a sharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire, and I stood with my back against the wall of the cave facing my unknown foe. And then the moonlight flooded the cave, and there before me lay my own body as it had been lying all these hours, with the eyes staring toward the open ledge and the hands resting limply upon the ground. I looked first at my lifeless clay there upon the floor of the cave and then down at myself in utter bewilderment; for there I lay clothed, and yet here I stood but naked as at the minute of my birth. The transition had been so sudden and so unexpected that it left me for a moment forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis. My first thought was, is this then death! Have I indeed passed over forever into that other life! But I could not well believe this, as I could feel my heart pounding against my ribs from the exertion of my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me. My breath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out from every pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed the fact that I was anything other than a wraith. Again was I suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave. Naked and unarmed as I was, I had no desire to face the unseen thing which menaced me. My revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which, for some unfathomable reason, I could not bring myself to touch. My carbine was in its boot, strapped to my saddle, and as my horse had wandered off I was left without means of defense. My only alternative seemed to lie in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the rustling sound from the thing which now seemed, in the darkness of the cave and to my distorted imagination, to be creeping stealthily upon me. Unable longer to resist the temptation to escape this horrible place I leaped quickly through the opening into the starlight of a clear Arizona night. The crisp, fresh mountain air outside the cave acted as an immediate tonic and I felt new life and new courage coursing through me. Pausing upon the brink of the ledge I upbraided myself for what now seemed to me wholly unwarranted apprehension. I reasoned with myself that I had lain helpless for many hours within the cave, yet nothing had molested me, and my better judgment, when permitted the direction of clear and logical reasoning, convinced me that the noises I had heard must have resulted from purely natural and harmless causes; probably the conformation of the cave was such that a slight breeze had caused the sounds I heard. I decided to investigate, but first I lifted my head to fill my lungs with the pure, invigorating night air of the mountains. As I did so I saw stretching far below me the beautiful vista of rocky gorge, and level, cacti-studded flat, wrought by the moonlight into a miracle of soft splendor and wondrous enchantment. Few western wonders are more inspiring than the beauties of an Arizona moonlit landscape; the silvered mountains in the distance, the strange lights and shadows upon hog back and arroyo, and the grotesque details of the stiff, yet beautiful cacti form a picture at once enchanting and inspiring; as though one were catching for the first time a glimpse of some dead and forgotten world, so different is it from the aspect of any other spot upon our earth. As I stood thus meditating, I turned my gaze from the landscape to the heavens where the myriad stars formed a gorgeous and fitting canopy for the wonders of the earthly scene. My attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant horizon. As I gazed upon it I felt a spell of overpowering fascination—it was Mars, the god of war, and for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power of irresistible enchantment. As I gazed at it on that far-gone night it seemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron. My longing was beyond the power of opposition; I closed my eyes, stretched out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself drawn with the suddenness of thought through the trackless immensity of space. There was an instant of extreme cold and utter darkness."
Ardath,""
Heart of Darkness,"The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of
the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly
calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come
to and wait for the turn of the tide.

The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of
an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded
together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails
of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A
haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.
The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed
condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,
and the greatest, town on earth.

The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four
affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness
personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.

Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of
the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's
yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had,
because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a
box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow
sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had
sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,
and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an
idol. The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way
aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing
but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and
exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a
speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the
Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded
rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the
gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more somber
every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.

And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and
from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat,
as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that
gloom brooding over a crowd of men.

Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less
brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested
unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the
race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a
waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the
venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and
departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And
indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,
""followed the sea"" with reverence and affection, than to evoke the
great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal
current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories
of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles
of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is
proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled
and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the
ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from
the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be
visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale,
to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests--and that never
returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from
Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;
kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the
dark ""interlopers"" of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned ""generals""
of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all
had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,
messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the
sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river
into the mystery of an unknown earth! . . . The dreams of men, the seed
of commonwealths, the germs of empires.

The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear
along the shore. The Chapman lighthouse, a three-legged thing erect on a
mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a great
stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the upper
reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on
the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.

""And this also,"" said Marlow suddenly, ""has been one of the dark places
of the earth.""

He was the only man of us who still ""followed the sea."" The worst that
could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a
seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may
so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home
order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their
country--the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is
always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign
shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,
veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.
For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not
inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it
out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these
misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination
of moonshine.

His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow.
It was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and
presently he said, very slow--

""I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here,
nineteen hundred years ago--the other day. . . . Light came out of this
river since--you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on
a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the
flicker--may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling! But
darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of a commander of
a fine--what d'ye call 'em?--trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered
suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry; put in
charge of one of these craft the legionaries,--a wonderful lot of handy
men they must have been too--used to build, apparently by the hundred,
in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him here--the
very end of the world, a sea the color of lead, a sky the color of
smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina--and going up this
river with stores, or orders, or what you like. Sandbanks, marshes,
forests, savages,--precious little to eat fit for a civilized man,
nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine here, no going
ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like a
needle in a bundle of hay--cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and
death,--death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush. They must
have been dying like flies here. Oh yes--he did it. Did it very well,
too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except
afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps.
They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he was cheered
by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna
by-and-by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful
climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too
much dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some prefect, or
tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp,
march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the
utter savagery, had closed round him,--all that mysterious life of the
wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of
wild men. There's no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to
live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And
it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination
of the abomination--you know. Imagine the growing regrets, the longing
to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.""

He paused.

""Mind,"" he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the
hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the
pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a
lotus-flower--""Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves
us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not
much account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was
merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and
for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have
it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of
others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to
be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great
scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle
a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking
it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter
noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too
much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not
a sentimental pretense but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the
idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a
sacrifice to. . . .""

He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red
flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each
other--then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city
went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on,
waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till the end of
the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in
a hesitating voice, ""I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn
fresh-water sailor for a bit,"" that we knew we were fated, before
the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive
experiences.

""I don't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,""
he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales
who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to
hear; ""yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I
got out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I
first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the
culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of
light on everything about me--and into my thoughts. It was somber enough
too--and pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear either.
No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.

""I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of
Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--a regular dose of the East--six years
or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and
invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to
civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get
tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship--I should think the
hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn't even look at me. And I got
tired of that game too.

""Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for
hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all
the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on
the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map
(but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, 'When
I grow up I will go there.' The North Pole was one of these places, I
remember. Well, I haven't been there yet, and shall not try now. The
glamour's off. Other places were scattered about the Equator, and in
every sort of latitude all over the two hemispheres. I have been in some
of them, and . . . well, we won't talk about that. But there was one
yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to speak--that I had a hankering
after.

""True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled
since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be
a blank space of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream
gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it
one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map,
resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its
body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the
depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window,
it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I
remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.
Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can't trade without using some
kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn't I
try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not
shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.

""You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but
I have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because it's cheap
and not so nasty as it looks, they say.

""I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh
departure for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I
always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I
wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--I felt somehow
I must get there by hook or by crook. So I worried them. The men said
'My dear fellow,' and did nothing. Then--would you believe it?--I tried
the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.
Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear
enthusiastic soul. She wrote: 'It will be delightful. I am ready to do
anything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a
very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots
of influence with,' &c., &c. She was determined to make no end of fuss
to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.

""I got my appointment--of course; and I got it very quick. It appears
the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed
in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the
more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when I
made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the
original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes,
two black hens. Fresleven--that was the fellow's name, a Dane--thought
himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to
hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didn't surprise
me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that
Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two
legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out
there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the
need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he
whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people
watched him, thunderstruck, till some man,--I was told the chief's
son,--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab
with a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between
the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest,
expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand,
the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of
the engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much
about Fresleven's remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I
couldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to
meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough
to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not
been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped
black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity
had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had
scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had
never returned. What became of the hens I don't know either. I should
think the cause of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this
glorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope
for it.
"
Ella Eris and The Pirates of Redemption,"Chapter One


The sunlight trickled down through the leaves and branches of the trees, landing in spots and splotches on the leafy forest floor. A young girl sat in the subdued light with her back against a spreading oak, her eyes almost closed. A faint wind toyed with the folds of her dress, but beyond that she sat completely motionless.

She willed her racing heart to slow, measuring her breaths, filling her lungs as slowly as possible, exhaling so gently that her breath would not have disturbed a feather, she made herself as still and silent as a stone. The rough texture of the tree’s bark bit into her back, and the root filled ground beneath her felt lumpy and uncomfortable, but these things mattered little to her.

The only thing that mattered was the raven. It stood less than three feet away from her pecking at the seed she had scattered on the ground. She had visited this spot every day for a week now, and each day the bird ventured a little closer. She knew it was the same bird by the distinctive scar over its left eye. The thought flitted through her mind that the raven might be toying with her, that it knew what she intended all along, but was drawing out the process as long as possible for inscrutable reasons of its own. Yesterday it had come close enough for her to reach out and touch it before it exploded into flight, leaving behind a single slender black feather that drifted erratically to the ground in front of her.

The bird hopped a few inches closer. She dared not even move her eyes in their sockets fearful they might make some sound and frighten the bird into flight. The bird hopped again. So close. Ella dared to look down at her hand lying limp and still on the forest floor, the palm pointed upward filled with seed. The raven hopped forward again, cocked its head to one side, then tentatively pecked at the seed in her hand.

Her hand twitched upward with the speed of a striking snake and grabbed the bird around the neck. The terrified animal squawked and flailed its wings, trying to twist its head and catch one of her fingers in its snapping beak, but Ella held firm.

She closed her eyes and saw the bird through the eyes in her hand. The hand saw so much more clearly. It saw the bird soaring in the morning air, and felt the rush of wind through its feathers. It saw beyond the body of the raven and saw its Form. Black and majestic. Made for the skies. The Form. It filled her mind like water filling a hollow in the ground, seeping into every crack and crevice until her Form and the Form of the raven were one.

Then she opened her hand and released the bird. Its wings blurred into a flurry of black that lifted it into the air as it screeched back at her for the indignity it had suffered.

She watched until the bird was lost from sight, not knowing what to feel. She knew the step she was about to take could be dangerous. Her mother had warned her again and again. “People don’t understand, Ella,” she had said. “And they’re afraid of things they don’t understand. If people found out it could be…dangerous.”

And over the years Ella had respected her mother’s wishes. But in the past few months something had changed. She had always had the ability to Change, but now it was becoming something more, a desire, no, a need to use her talent that grew with each passing day. This is what I am, she thought. I can’t go through life hiding from it.

So she closed her eyes and focused on the Form of the bird. It was more than a shape. It was the essence of what the raven was. She opened her mind and let herself flow into it. It wasn’t something anyone had ever taught her. It couldn’t be taught, any more than a corpse could be taught to breathe, or a stone could learn to fly.

Ella opened her eyes and looked out through the eyes of the raven. The animal’s instincts meshed with her own thoughts as naturally as if she had been born in this body. She launched herself upwards, her wings beating hard against the air. She climbed through the porous canopy of leaves and branches and soared up into the sunlight. She flew higher and higher, far above the forest that grew up the side of the mountain. Below her the valley stretched out small and delicate, like a map brought to life. She saw wisps of smoke curling from the chimney of the blacksmith, and just up the road she saw Mr. Bartlett’s general store, an ugly brown building which always seemed to have everything they needed and nothing she wanted. And there on the outskirts of town stood the inn that she and her mother had called home for as long as she could remember. It had once seemed to her that the world could not extend far beyond the borders of the valley, but now she realized what a tiny piece of the world Caelum truly was. The mountains went on and on like a rumpled blanket made of earth and stone, and far beyond that she saw the beginnings of a great plain.

She felt nearly intoxicated by the experience but, she knew she couldn’t stay out too long without her mother suspecting the truth. But she couldn’t bring herself to come down, not now, not yet, not while the unseen parts of the world were calling to her. She turned on the breeze and let it carry her down the valley away from Caelum, following the road that cut through the valley, and led to the outside world. It looked small and inconsequential winding through the vast expanse of mountains.

When she was younger she had spent countless hours watching the road for travelers, but they were rare and never stayed for very long. During the winter when the mountain passes filled with snow, there were no travelers at all, but now the warmth of spring had melted the sparkling drifts into icy water that fed down into the rushing mountain streams. But even with the snow gone the passes could be dangerous. She had heard that in some places the road was barely navigable in the best conditions.

Ella had never ventured down the path that connected the tiny town to the outside world, but looking down from her elevated vantage point Ella could see that the road was as dangerous as she had heard. Barely a mile outside of town the path took a sharp turn high up on the side of the mountain. Ella glided closer to the treacherous turn amazed at the gaping chasm that yawned below the rough road.

Then something caught her eye. From this distance it was hard to see, but there was something at the bottom of the cliff, a shape that didn’t seem quite right. She glided in for a closer look, curious to find out what it was. Her curiosity turned to panic when she saw that the odd shape was the body of a man, crumpled and broken on the rocks. Ella flew faster now, beating her wings hard against the wind, pushing herself forward with every ounce of strength she had.

Even as she flew towards the body, part of her wanted to turn back. The man was almost certainly dead, and probably had been for some time.

Ella had only seen a dead body once before. When she was eight her mother had sent her to bring some supplies to an old man who lived like a hermit in a secluded stone cottage up the far side of the valley. It had been summer time and by the time Ella found the body the stench was overwhelming. She hadn’t stuck around for long, but the image of the old man sitting in his rocking chair, his eyes staring at nothing while flies swarmed over his pale skin had branded itself into her memory.

But as much as she wanted to turn back she knew she had to at least check, to be sure there was nothing she could do to help. And there was something else too - a kind of morbid curiosity lurking behind her other emotions, excited at the idea of seeing the touch of death again.

She swooped lower and lower until her flight brought her to the bottom of the cliff. Even before she changed back into herself she knew the man was dead. His limbs where twisted beneath him with angles in places that no joint existed and the ground beneath his head was stained with the rust brown of dried blood. Ella crept closer, swallowing the fear creeping up in her throat and reminding herself that there was nothing less dangerous than a dead body.

Then she noticed the man’s clothes for the first time. They were unlike anything she had ever seen before. The material, if it could be called that, was black. Ella had a black dress that she hardly ever wore because it was a bit too small for her now, but that kind of black was only pretending to be the black that the dead man’s clothes were made of. It was a magical color, as if someone had captured the essence of midnight and spun cloth from it. Ella reached out and brushed her fingers against it, to assure herself it was real, then quickly withdrew her hand horrified at having touched the corpse.

She sat there for a moment, not moving, barely breathing, just looking at the dead man. She knew he could not have been dead for very long. The body hadn’t started to stink yet, and only a smattering of flies flitted around the corpse, feasting on the clotted blood and clustering around the unblinking eyes, eyes that stared out at nothing, frozen in an eternal expression of terror. Ella looked up at the cliff above and imagined the fall, the sickening feeling of rushing air and the ground coming up beneath you.

Who are you? she thought, and how did you get here? The nearest town was more than twenty miles down the road, too far for anyone travel on foot in the dead of night.

Ella pushed the questions to the back of her mind. She couldn’t stay here much longer. She had already been gone for nearly an hour and the return trip would take several minutes at the least. Still, she couldn’t leave the body to rot and dry in the sun, exposed to the vultures and other scavengers that would pick the bones clean in a matter of weeks. She fought back her revulsion, grabbed the dead man by his cloak, and dragged the body against the cliff wall. Then she started to cover the mangled form with the loose rocks that littered the ground at the base of the cliff.

She was almost finished when she noticed that the dead man was clutching something in his hand. She looked closer and saw a small loop of silver chain emerging from between the fingers of the dead man’s fist. She tugged at it experimentally but the dead man’s grasp had tightened in death and she couldn’t budge the chain. Even as she pried the stiff cold fingers open she told herself that this was none of her business, that she should just leave it alone.

Then the chain fell to the ground with a musical tinkling sound, and Ella saw what the man had been clutching. It was a small black ring. She grasped the it between her fingers and held the it up to the light.

She was immediately struck by how heavy it felt, almost impossibly heavy for an object so small. As first she thought it might be made from obsidian or some strange black metal but she quickly realized that the ring was something far stranger. It hung in the air as black as a slice of pure darkness. If Ella had thought the man’s robes were black, then this was something different entirely. She reached out brushing the ring with her fingers and watched it swing back and forth. It was odd how the ring seemed not to reflect the light as if it were less than solid, less than real.

In the distance she heard the clop-clop of horse hooves coming up the path above her, and the groaning of a wagon’s wheels rolling along behind. Ella pressed herself against the cliff wall and waited for the sound to pass overhead. When it was silent again, she hurriedly worked to finish covering the body, the ring still hanging from the chain in her left hand.

She had to hurry back. She had already been gone too long. She looked at the ring again.

What are you doing Ella? she asked herself. It doesn’t belong to you.

It belongs to me as much as anybody, she countered. W_hy shouldn’t I take it?_

It looks dangerous. Leave it here.

But she didn’t. She slipped the chain over her head and tucked the ring into the collar of her dress. Again she was stuck by how heavy the thing seemed hanging there, pulling the chain so that the fine links bit into her neck.

She turned back to her task and continued piling stones over the body until she was sure it was safe from scavengers. When she had finished she looked down at the pile of rocks and bid a silent farewell to a man she had never known.





Chapter Two


Ella let her mind rest on the Form of the bird, and felt herself flow into it. She took off and flew as fast as she could.

Within fifteen minutes she touched down in the clearing, and changed back into herself. She sprinted down the path towards the town, slowing down only to wobble her way over the log that bridged the swollen brook. When she came in sight of the inn she slowed to a walk, and tried to affect an expression of nonchalance that she hoped would deflect any suspicions her mother might have. When she reached the inn she paused then opened the back door door and stepped into the dining hall. The room was empty, but that was hardly unusual.

She poked her head into the adjoining kitchen expecting to find her mother nursing a pot of stew, but was surprised to find that it was empty as well. Then she heard the sound of muffled voices and footsteps floating down from above her. She climbed the creaky wooden stairway up to the second floor of the inn where three thinly furnished rooms usually sat empty waiting for some rare traveler in need of shelter to occupy them. She found her mother in the hallway talking to a man Ella had never seen before.

“Oh there you are dear. I was just telling our guest that I was starting to wonder where you’d got to.”

“I must have lost track of time,” Ella replied, smiling in what she hoped was a disarming way. “The weather’s so beautiful this time of year.”

“Aye, the spring air in these mountains is as sweet as honey,” said the newcomer. “Somethin’ about things growing after the winter gives things a different feel. Like the whole world walkin’ with a spring in its step.”

“This is Julius, Ella,” her mother said. “He’ll be staying the night with us. Julius, this is my daughter Ella.”

Julius extended his hand and Ella shook it. He was a large man, but perhaps not big enough to be called fat. He had dark blue eyes, a nose several sizes too large for his face and a shiny bald head with a single wisp of white hair at the very top.

“Pleased to meet you Mr. Julius.”

Julius leaned down and whispered in her ear, but loud enough her mother to hear, “I’d prefer you skip the ‘mister’ part. Makes me feel old you know.”

Ella smiled, although in that moment she found herself trying to determine how old he really was with little success.

“Okay then. Julius. How long will you be staying here in Caelum?”

“I’m just passing through on my way to the coast. The next town is almost a whole day’s journey down the road, so I thought I’d stop here and save myself the trouble of bedding down under the stars.”

“It’s a good thing you did,” said Ella’s mother. “That road is dangerous even during the day and at nighttime it can be deadly.”

Ella caught herself nodding, thinking of the dead man. Her mother went on talking without taking notice.

“You’ll be sure to take extra care when you leave tomorrow Mr. Julius -Oh I’m sorry, I mean just Julius.”

“It’s okay ma’am,” Julius said. “I appreciate the concern. I’ll be sure and keep an eye out for trouble.”

“Well, come along Ella,” her mother said. “We should be getting lunch ready,” she turned back to Julius. “Will you be joining us?”

Julius grinned. “Never say no to food ma’am. I’ll be there.”

Ella followed her mother downstairs, where she spent the next few minutes helping her mother get things ready. The inn’s primary purpose was to provide a place for the people of the town to meet and eat. Although they did have rooms to accommodate travelers, they were rarely used, even in the spring and summer months. Caelum was a fairly obscure town, and most travelers followed the northern roads, which took the long way around the mountains but were far easier to navigate.

Ella’s thoughts wandered again to the dead man. He might have stayed at the inn if things had been different. She tried to imagine him as he might have been when he was alive. That face, smiling and laughing as he ate at the table. The image suddenly made his death seem more real and tragic, like she imagined death was supposed to feel. Her mother’s voice interrupted her reverie.

“What’s wrong dear? You look worried.”

Ella put on a smile and shook her head. “No I’m not worried. I guess I was just thinking.”

“Oh? About what?”

Ella paused then answered, “I was thinking about death.”

“Oh,” her mother said, looking a bit surprised. “Well that is serious. May I ask what could have brought on such a morbid train of thought?”

Ella shrugged. “I don’t know,” she lied.

“Thinking of anyone’s death in particular?”

“Not really. I guess it’s just a scary thought. That one day your life ends and there’s nothing left.”

“Well don’t let it bother you too much dear. Hopefully you won’t have to worry about it for a good long while.”

“Some of us will have to worry about starving to death if we don’t get some lunch soon,” said a gruff voice from the kitchen doorway.

Ella’s mother turned from her cooking to face the voice’s owner. “If you don’t have enough manners to know not to listen at my kitchen door, I have half a mind not to serve you Zebadiah.” The words were harsh, but the tone was not. Ella doubted her mother could ever be really angry with the man who had spoken. Even before she turned Ella had his face in her mind. It was an old face with more wrinkles than the mountains had valleys and it belonged to Zebadiah Jones.

“No harm meant, Miss Eris,” Zebadiah said quickly. “I was just hungry, and I s’pose my curiosity got the better of me.”

“Well go and sit down, and Ella will bring your food out directly,” said Ella’s mother.

Zebadiah nodded quickly and disappeared around the door. Ella knew without being told what the old man would have: a pot of stew and some water. Elle dished the stew into a bowl, and filled a wooden goblet with water. She brought them both out and put them in front of the old man.

“Thankee,” he said. “Thankee very much.”

Zebadiah dipped his spoon into the bowl of steaming stew and stuffed it into his mouth. “So what’s got yer mind thinking on the Specter Miss Ella?” he mumbled, his mouth opening slightly to reveal the half chewed food inside.

“The Specter?” Ella asked confused. “What’s that?”

Zebadiah washed down the mouthful of stew with a gulp of water and said, “You know. The Specter, the Ferryman, the Reaper of Souls. Death.”

Ella shook her head. “I don’t understand. You’re saying death is a person?”

“Well not a person as such. I guess its just superstition. Not much worth talking about really,” he said, taking another bite of stew.

But by now Ella was intrigued, and she wasn’t about to be put off that easily. “Tell me about it,” she insisted, sitting with her back to the table on the bench next to the old man.

And Zebadiah, whom Ella had never known to pass up the opportunity to tell a story, smiled and said, “Well if you insist. Though truly there’s not much to tell. Its more of an idea than anything else, the Specter is. A very old idea.”

“How old?”

“Older than anyone could ever know. As old as death I reckon. But the old ideas have power and this one goes a ways back. Back to the beginning maybe. You see, every living thing has a soul. It’s like the thing inside you that’s really you, that makes you alive. But the thing about the soul is that it don’t die when the body dies. It sort of hangs around with nothin’ to do. And that’s where the Specter comes in. The old legends say that he collects the souls of the dead and takes them far over the sea to the Island of the Dead.”

“And what happens then?” Ella asked.

Zebadiah shrugged. “Dunno. I reckon I’ll have to die to find out. I don’t s’pose it’ll be too much longer, for an old codger like me eh?” he said laughing.

“That’s not funny,” Ella said.

“No, maybe not. But it don’t do to worry too much about it before it happens. Besides Ella, none of us lives forever in this world and nothing’s gonna change that. Best do the most you can with the life you have.”

“Ella,” her mother’s called from the kitchen, “Can you come in here and peel these potatoes for me?.”

“Yes, ma’am. Coming,” Ella replied. She left Zebadiah with his stew and went back into the kitchen where a pile of potatoes sat on the table. Ella picked up a knife and started peeling the dry brown skin off the potatoes all the while thinking about what Zebadiah had said. Was it true? Was there really someone or something that came for you after you were dead? What happened after that? And then she thought of the old man’s words. “I reckon I’ll have to die to find out.”

She finished peeling the potatoes and gave them to her mother who was just pulling a loaf of bread out of the oven.

“Thank you, Ella. I think I heard our new guest come down. Would you go and see what he’d like to eat?”

Ella looked into the dining room and saw that Julius was there, sitting across the table from Zebadiah, talking with the old man as if he had known him for years.

“I didn’t know there was any kind of mining operation in these parts,” Julius was saying.

“Well, there was,” Zebadiah answered. “That’s how this town, if you can call it that, came to be out here in the middle of nowhere. Some old prospector discovered gold in these parts and next thing you know this lot sprang up.”

“And then?”

“Gold ran out,” Zebadiah explained. “And everyone left. Well most everyone anyway.”

“And the rest?”

Zebadiah shrugged. “There’s always a few folks that like to be away from civilization for one reason or another. I’m the only one still left that fools with the mine at all.”

“Ever find anything?”

“Oh, the odd nugget here and there. Mostly I just do it to keep myself occupied.”

“Excuse me,” Ella said, “I don’t mean to interrupt, but mother wanted me to find out what you wanted to eat Mr. Julius.”

” I’ll have some of that stew,” Julius said pointing to the wooden bowl in front of Zebadiah, “If there’s any left, that is.”

” I’m sure there is,” Ella said. The pot of stew was still warming on the stove, and Ella ladled it into another bowl and brought it out.

“Thank you Ella,” Julius said when she set it in front of him. “I hadn’t realized how hungry I was until I smelled that home cookin’.”

“Best chow for miles,” Zebadiah said.

“Care to join us Miss Ella?” Julius said.

Ella shrugged. “I guess I can.”. She went into the kitchen and poured a bowl of stew for herself, then joined Julius and Zebadiah at the table. When she returned, Zebadiah was asking Julius where he was from.

“Well I was born in Riparia,” Julius said, “but these days I don’t claim any land as my home. Most of my time is spent travelin’.”

” But what do you do?” Ella asked.

Julius shrugged. “Odds and ends,” he said. “At the moment I’m in the transport business. There’s always someone who needs somethin’ moved from here to there.”

” Sound’s interesting,” said Zebadiah.

” Can be,” Julius agreed, “but it can also be risky. There’s thieves, bandits, the odd goblin, here and there. Some of ‘em want your cargo and some just want trouble.”

” You’ve fought a goblin?” Zebadiah asked with an incredulous edge in his voice.

” Well to tell you the truth I ran away from him,” Julius admitted. “But I didn’t lose the load, my horses, or most importantly, my life.”

“What’s a goblin?” Ella asked.

“Nasty buggers,” Zebadiah said. “Green skin, sharp claws, lotsa teeth, and generally ugly as sin.”

“Seen one?” Julius asked.

“Only once, but that was plenty let me tell you.”

“Tell us about it,” Ella pleaded, but Zebadiah pushed back his chair and stood up.

“Not today lass. I’ve got to get back to the mine. At my age if I don’t keep movin’ my body might forget it’s not dead yet.”

Zebadiah said his goodbyes and shuffled out of the room. Just after he left Ella’s mother came in from the kitchen. “I trust my daughter isn’t boring you Mr. Julius,” she said.

“No, no, Mrs. Eris, not at all”

“It’s ‘Miss’,” Ella’s mother corrected.

“Oh, I beg your pardon ma’am.” Julius began to apologize, but Ella’s mother dismissed it with a wave of her hand, and a polite smile.

“It’s nothing to worry about,” she said. “Did you find the room to your liking?”

Ella picked up her empty bowl and left the two adults to their discussion. She knew how these conversations went. It amazed her how people could talk and not really say anything. She washed her bowl out in the kitchen and climbed to the inn’s attic. This was Ella’s territory, a world apart where she could look down on things from a disaffected vantage point. She had always loved the attic. It had a spacious feel to it though the slanting ceiling could make things seem cramped at times.

There were only a few pieces of simple furniture in the room. Her bed was pushed close to the slanting ceiling, and near the mouth of the stairs, a simple writing desk sat in front of the attic window that looked out over the town. At the far end of the room a simple wooden box which served as a wardrobe stood against the wall.

She shut the door behind her and sat down at her desk feeling excited and a little anxious. She reached for the chain around her neck, pulled it up over her head and stared at the ring dangling at the end. She paused for a moment then unclasped the chain and slipped the ring off into her palm. She turned it over and over in her fingers feeling the improbable weight of the thing. This was no ordinary ring. From the very moment she had seen it Ella had known that. Was it magic? Did it have something to do with how the man in black had died?

It must have been very important, Ella thought remembering how tightly the dead fingers had been clenched around the ring.

Yes, important, a second thought echoed back and probably dangerous too.

But what’s an adventure without danger?

The thought had been growing in Ella’s mind like a cloud changing in the sky. It could have been forming since she first saw the ring, or it might have only popped up in that instant, but once it had lodged in her mind there was no denying it. The ring was an adventure waiting to happen. She had to know where it would take her. For a moment she wavered, but only for a moment, and then, with trembling hands, she slipped the ring onto her finger."

HARRY 

POTTER 




/ 




THE WORST BIRTHDAY 

Not for the first time, an argument had broken out 
over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. 
Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of 
the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew 
Harry’s room. 

“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If 
you can’t control that owl, it’ll have to go!” 

Harry tried, yet again, to explain. 

“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around 
outside. If I could just let her out at night — ” 

“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of 
fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. “I know 
what 11 happen if that owl’s let out.” 

He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. 

Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned 
by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley. 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 



“I want more bacon.” 



“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt 
Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We 
must build you up while we’ve got the chance. ... I 
don’t like the sound of that school food. ...” 

“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when / was 
at Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley 
gets enough, don’t you, son?” 

Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over 
either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to 
Harry. 

“Pass the frying pan.” 

“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry 
irritably. 

The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the 
family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his 
chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. 
Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands 
to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins 
throbbing in his temples. 

“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean 



“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, 
spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ 
WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” 

“But I — ” 

“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared 
Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. 



Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“I just — ” 



“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION 
OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” 

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale 
aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. 

“All right,” said Harry, “all right ...” 

Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded 
rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the 
corners of his small, sharp eyes. 

Ever since Harry had come home for the summer 
holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a 
bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry 
Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he 
was as not normal as it is possible to be. 

Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his 
first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have 
him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how 
Harry felt. 

He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a 
constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its 
secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though 
perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail 
arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, 
sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, 
visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to 
the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, 
Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding 
world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and 
fourteen players on broomsticks). 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and 
top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had 
been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle 
Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did 
the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House 
Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all 
summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went 
back to school without any of his homework done? 

The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a 
drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as 
they were concerned, having a wizard in the family 
was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had 
even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, 
to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the 
wizarding world. 

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle 
Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous 
black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and 
bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on 
the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant 
green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. 
He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a 
thin, lightning-shaped scar. 

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly 
unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only 
hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he 
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years 
before. 

At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow 
survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all 
time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and 
wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died 
in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his 
lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood 
why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the 
instant he had failed to kill Harry. 

Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s 
sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with 
the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept 
making odd things happen without meaning to, 
believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar 
in the car crash that had killed his parents. 

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to 
Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had 
taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his 
scar were famous . . . but now the school year was 
over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the 
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had 
rolled in something smelly. 

The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today 
happened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, 
his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a 
real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it 
completely ... 

At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat 
importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a 
very important day.” 

Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. 

“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of 
my career,” said Uncle Vernon. 

Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought 
bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid 
dinner party. He’d been talking of nothing else for two 
weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to 
dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge 
order from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills). 



Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“I think we should run through the schedule one 
more time,” said Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in 
position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be — ?” 

“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting 
to welcome them graciously to our home.” 

“Good, good. And Dudley?” 

“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a 
foul, simpering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and 
Mrs. Mason?” 

“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. 

“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he 
rounded on Harry. “And you?” 

“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and 
pretending I’m not there,” said Harry tonelessly. 

“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them 
into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour 
them drinks. At eight-fifteen — ” 

“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia. 

“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ” 

“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. 
Mason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an 
invisible woman. 

“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia. 

“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. 

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending 
I’m not there,” said Harry dully. 

Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good 
compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?” 



“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. 

Mason. ... Do tell me where you bought your dress, 
Mrs. Mason. ...” 

“Perfect ... Dudley?” 

“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our 
hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ” 

This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. 
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, 
while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t 
see him laughing. 

“And you, boy?” 

Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. 

“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending 
I’m not there,” he said. 

“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 

“The Masons don’t know anything about you and it’s 
going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take 
Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, 
and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any 
luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the 
news at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in 
Majorca this time tomorrow.” 

Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t 
think the Dursleys would like him any better in 
Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. 

“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner 
jackets for Dudley and me. And you,” he snarled at 

Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s 
cleaning.” 

Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, 
sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on 
the garden bench, and sang under his breath: 

“Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...” 

No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the 
evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably 
into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than 
anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing 
Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron 
Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t 
seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had 
written to him all summer, even though Ron had said 
he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. 

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of 
unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to 
Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth 
the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use 
magic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the 
Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he 
might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped 
them from locking him in the cupboard under the 
stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first 
couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering 
nonsense words under his breath and watching 
Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs 
would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and 
Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the 
magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its 
appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten 
his birthday. 

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from 
Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to 
be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. ... 

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At 
the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face 
with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. 
Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he 
was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to 
regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s 
clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow 
escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking 
in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where 
Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his 
wide, mad eyes — 

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. 
He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge 
— and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous 
green eyes had appeared among the leaves. 

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated 
across the lawn. 

“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward 
him. 

The huge eyes blinked and vanished. 

“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot 
where they had been. 

“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right 
up to him. 

“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the 
days of the week.”

“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come 
you haven’t got any cards? Haven’t you even got 
friends at that freak place?” 

“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my 
school,” said Harry coolly. 

Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping 
down his fat bottom. 

“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said 
suspiciously. 

“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to 
set it on fire,” said Harry. 

Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic 
on his fat face. 

“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic 
— he said hell chuck you out of the house — and you 
haven’t got anywhere else to go — you haven’t got any 
friends to take you — ” 

“ Jiggery pokeryV ’ said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus 
pocus — squiggly wiggly — ” 

“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet 
as he dashed back toward the house. “MUUUUM! 

He’s doing you know what!” 

Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither 
Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt 
Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but he still 
had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head 
with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to 
do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d 
finished. 



Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice 
cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, 
mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and 
watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. 
The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his 
neck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s 
bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had 
been thinking himself ... maybe he didn’t have any 
friends at Hogwarts. ... 

Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he 
thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower 
beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. 

It was half past seven in the evening when at last, 
exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him. 

“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!” 

Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming 
kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: 
a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. 
A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. 

“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped 
Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a 
lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already 
wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. 

Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful 
supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia 
whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!” 

As he passed the door to the living room, Harry 
caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow 
ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the 
upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle 
Vernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the 
stairs. 

Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Remember, boy — one sound — ” 

Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped 
inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his 
bed. 

The trouble was, there was already someone sitting 
on it. 



Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 






DOBBY’S WARNING 

Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close 
thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat- 
like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis 
balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had 
been watching him out of the garden hedge that 
morning. 

As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s 
voice from the hall. 

“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” 

The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low 
that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. 
Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an 
old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. 

“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously. 

“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched 
voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. “So 



Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 



long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ... Such an 
honor it is. ...” 

“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and 
sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was 
asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, “What are 
you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead 
he said, “Who are you?” 

“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said 
the creature. 

“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be 
rude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me 
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” 

Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the 
living room. The elf hung his head. 

“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry 
quickly, “but, er, is there any particular reason you’re 
here?” 

“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come 
to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders 
where to begin. ...” 

“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. 

To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy 
tears. 

“S-sit down).” he wailed. “Never ... never ever ...” 

Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. 

“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you 
or anything — ” 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never 
been asked to sit down by a wizard — like an equal — 



Harry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the 
same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where 
he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly 
doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat 
with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of 
watery adoration. 

“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said 
Harry, trying to cheer him up. 

Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he 
leapt up and started banging his head furiously on 
the window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!” 

“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed, 
springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed — 
Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud 
screech and was beating her wings wildly against the 
bars of her cage. 

“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who 
had gone slightly cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill 
of his family, sir. ...” 

“Your family?” 

“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. ... Dobby is a 
house-elf — bound to serve one house and one family 
forever. ...” 

“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously. 
Dobby shuddered. 



Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself 
most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will 
have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they 
ever knew, sir — ” 

“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the 
oven door?” 

“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to 
punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get 
on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do 
extra punishments. ...” 

“But why don’t you leave? Escape?” 

“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will 
never set Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family 
until he dies, sir. ...” 

Harry stared. 

“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another 
four weeks,” he said. “This makes the Dursleys sound 
almost human. Can’t anyone help you? Can’t I?” 

Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken. 

Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude. 

“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet. 
If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you’re 
here — ” 

“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has 
heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, 
Dobby never knew. ...” 

Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, 
“Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load 



Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




of rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; 
that’s Hermione, she — ” 

But he stopped quickly, because thinking about 
Hermione was painful. 

“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby 
reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. “Harry Potter 
speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named — ” 

“Voldemort?” said Harry. 

Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and 
moaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the 
name!” 

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people 
don’t like it. My friend Ron — ” 

He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, 
too. 

Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as 
headlights. 

“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry 
Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just 
weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped yet again.” 

Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with 
tears. 

“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of 
the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter 
is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers 
already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, 
to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in 



Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




the oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back 
to Hogwarts.” 

There was a silence broken only by the chink of 
knives and forks from downstairs and the distant 
rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice. 

“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back 
— term starts on September first. It’s all that’s 
keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like here. 

I don’t belong here. I belong in your world — at 
Hogwarts.” 

“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so 
hard his ears flapped. “Harry Potter must stay where 
he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry 
Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal 
danger.” 

“Why?” said Harry in surprise. 

“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most 
terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispered Dobby, 
suddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has known it for 
months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in 
peril. He is too important, sir!” 

“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s 
plotting them?” 

Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged 
his head frantically against the wall. 

“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop 
him. “You can’t tell me. I understand. But why are 
you warning me?” A sudden, unpleasant thought 
struck him. “Hang on — this hasn’t got anything to 
do with Vol — sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it? 
Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




You could just shake or nod,” he added hastily as 
Dobby’s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. 

Slowly, Dobby shook his head. 

“Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir — ” 

But Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be 
trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was 
completely lost. 

“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?” 

Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever. 

“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a 
chance of making horrible things happen at 
Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, 
for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t 
you?” 

Dobby bowed his head. 

“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster 
Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby 
has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of He- 
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his 
strength. But, sir” — Dobby’s voice dropped to an 
urgent whisper — “there are powers Dumbledore 
doesn’t ... powers no decent wizard ...” 

And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off 
the bed, seized Harry’s desk lamp, and started 
beating himself around the head with earsplitting 
yelps. 

A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later 
Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon 



Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




coming into the hall, calling, “Dudley must have left 
his television on again, the little tyke!” 

“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby 
in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the 
bed just as the door handle turned. 

“What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said 
Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly 
close to Harry’s. “You’ve just ruined the punch line of 
my Japanese golfer joke. ... One more sound and 
you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!” 

He stomped flat-footed from the room. 

Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. 

“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to 
go back to Hogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got — 
well, I think I’ve got friends.” 

“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said 
Dobby slyly. 

“I expect they’ve just been — wait a minute,” said 
Harry, frowning. “How do you know my friends 
haven’t been writing to me?” 

Dobby shuffled his feet. 

“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Dobby 
did it for the best — ” 

“Have you been stopping my letters?” 

“Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping 
nimbly out of Harry’s reach, he pulled a thick wad of 
envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was 
wearing. Harry could make out Hermione’s neat 

Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




writing, Ron’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that 
looked as though it was from the Hogwarts 
gamekeeper, Hagrid. 

Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. 

“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. ... Dobby hoped ... if 
Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . . 
Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. 



Harry wasn’t listening. He made a grab for the letters, 
but Dobby jumped out of reach. 

“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his 
word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this 
is a danger you must not face! Say you won’t go back, 
sir!” 

“No,” said Harry angrily. “Give me my friends’ letters!” 

“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” said the 
elf sadly. 

Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the 
bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the 
stairs. 

Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, 
trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six 
steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking 
around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard 
Uncle Vernon saying, ""... tell Petunia that very funny 
story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. 
She’s been dying to hear ...” 

Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his 
stomach disappear. 



Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




Aunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the 
mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating 
up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the 
corner crouched Dobby. 

“No,” croaked Harry. “Please ... they’ll kill me. ...” 
“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school 



“Dobby ... please ...” 

“Say it, sir — ” 

“I can’t — ” 

Dobby gave him a tragic look. 

“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own 
good.” 

The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping 
crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the 
dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby 
vanished. 

There were screams from the dining room and Uncle 
Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with 
shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia’s 
pudding. 

At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would 
manage to gloss the whole thing over. (“Just our 
nephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets 
him, so we kept him upstairs. ...”) He shooed the 
shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised 
Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life 
when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. 
Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer 
Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the 
kitchen clean. 

Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his 
deal — if it hadn’t been for the owl. 

Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after- 
dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through 
the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. 
Mason’s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason 
screamed like a banshee and ran from the house 
shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long 
enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally 
afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask 
whether this was their idea of a joke. 

Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for 
support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a 
demonic glint in his tiny eyes. 

“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the 
owl had delivered. “Go on — read it!” 

Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was 
used at your place of residence this evening at twelve 
minutes past nine. 

As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to 
perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on 
your part may lead to expulsion from said school 
(Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage 
Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). 

We would also ask you to remember that any magical 
activity that risks notice by members of the non- 

P a g e | 24 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense 
under section 13 of the International Confederation of 
Warlocks’ Statute of Secrecy. 

Enjoy your holidays! 

Yours sincerely, 

Mafalda Hopkirk 

IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE 
Ministry of Magic 

Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. 

“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic 
outside school,” said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam 
dancing in his eyes. “Forgot to mention it. ... Slipped 
your mind, I daresay. ...” 

He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, 
all his teeth bared. “Well, I’ve got news for you, boy. ... 
I’m locking you up. ... You’re never going back to that 
school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself 
out — they 11 expel you!” 

And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back 
upstairs. 

Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following 
morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window. 
He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so 
that small amounts of food could be pushed inside 
three times a day. They let Harry out to use the 
bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was 
locked in his room around the clock. 



Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling 




Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign 
of relenting, and Harry couldn’t see any way out of his 
situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking 
behind the bars on the window and wondered 
miserably what was going to happen to him. 

What was the good of magicking himself out of his 
room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life 
at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that 
the Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as 
fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might 
have saved Harry from horrible happenings at 
Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he’d 
probably starve to death anyway. 

The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia’s hand 
appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the 
room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, 
jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone- 
cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he 
crossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the 
soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her 
empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave 
him a look of deep disgust. 

“It’s no good turning your beak up at it — that’s all 
we’ve got,” said Harry grimly. 

He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the 
cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even 
hungrier than he had been before the soup. 

Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, 
what would happen if he didn’t turn up at Hogwarts? 
Would someone be sent to see why he hadn’t come 
back? Would they be ab"
Harry Potter - OWL POST,"/ 




OWL POST 

Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. 
For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more 
than any other time of year. For another, he really 
wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in 
secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to 
be a wizard. 

It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his 
stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his 
head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large 
leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda 
Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry 
moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, 
frowning as he looked for something that would help 
him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth 
Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.” 

The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking 
paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the 
bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the 
book, and read: 



Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 



Non-magic people (more commonly known as 
Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval 
times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare 
occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, 
burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard 
would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and 
then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a 
gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird 
enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed 
herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in 
various disguises. 

Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached 
underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of 
parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed 
the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to 
write, pausing every now and then to listen, because 
if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill 
on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find 
himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for 
the rest of the summer. 

The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was 
the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer 
holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, 
Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were 
Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude 
toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had been a 
witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned 
under the Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and 
Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as 
downtrodden as possible, they would be able to 
squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had 
been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of 
anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the 
last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to 
lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and 



Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




broomstick at the start of the summer break, and 
forbid him to talk to the neighbors. 

This separation from his spellbooks had been a real 
problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts 
had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the 
essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking 
potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher, 
Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an 
excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had 
therefore seized his chance in the first week of the 
holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and 
Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire 
Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices, 
so that the rest of the street would notice it too), 

Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the 
cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his 
books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as 
he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the 
Dursleys need never know that he was studying 
magic by night. 

Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his 
aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already 
in an especially bad mood with him, all because he’d 
received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one 
week into the school vacation. 

Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at 
Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This 
meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but 
had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it 
had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call. 

“Vernon Dursley speaking.” 

Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, 
froze as he heard Ron’s voice answer. 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




“HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT — 
TO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!” 

Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped 
and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring 
at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm. 

“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the 
mouthpiece. “WHO ARE YOU?” 

“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he 
and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends 
of a football field. “I’M — A — FRIEND — OF — 
HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL — ” 

Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, 
who was rooted to the spot. 

“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, 
now holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though 
frightened it might explode. “I DONT KNOW WHAT 
SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER 
CONTACT ME AGAIN! DONT YOU COME NEAR MY 
FAMILY!” 

And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as 
if dropping a poisonous spider. 

The fight that had followed had been one of the worst 
ever. 

“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE 
LIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU!” Uncle Vernon had 
roared, spraying Harry with spit. 

Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into 
trouble, because he hadn’t called again. Harry’s other 
best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t 
been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had 

Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, 
because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s 
year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to 
use a telephone, and would probably have had 
enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts. 

So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding 
friends for five long weeks, and this summer was 
turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There 
was just one very small improvement — after 
swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to 
any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his 
owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in 
because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked 
in her cage all the time. 

Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and 
paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house 
was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his 
enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry 
thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. 

Perhaps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. ... 

He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old 
pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A 
History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got 
out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard 
under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and 
checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his 
bedside table. 

It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach 
gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old, 
without realizing it, for a whole hour. 

Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little 
he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never 
received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys had 



Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had 
no reason to suppose they would remember this one. 

Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s 
large, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on 
the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a 
long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been 
absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried 
about her: she’d been gone this long before. But he 
hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living 
creature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of 
him. 

Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his 
age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His 
jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had 
been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The 
eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his 
forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin 
scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning. 

Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was 
the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the 
Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of 
the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because 
Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. 
They had been murdered, murdered by the most 
feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord 
Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack 
with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where 
Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had 
rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, 

Voldemort had fled. ... 

But Harry had come face-to-face with him at 
Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he 
stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was 
lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday. 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, 
perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse 
dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing 
absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before 
Harry realized what he was seeing. 

Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing 
larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided 
creature, and it was flapping in Harry’s direction. He 
stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For 
a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window 
latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then 
the bizarre creature soared over one of the street 
lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it 
was, leapt aside. 

Through the window soared three owls, two of them 
holding up the third, which appeared to be 
unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on 
Harry’s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and 
gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was 
a large package tied to its legs. 

Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his 
name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley 
family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords 
around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then 
carried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one 
bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to 
gulp some water. 

Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of 
them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig. 
She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely 
pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate 
nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then 
flew across the room to join Errol. 



Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome 
tawny one, but he knew at once where it had come 
from, because in addition to a third package, it was 
carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When 
Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its 
feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off 
through the window into the night. 

Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s 
package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a 
present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday 
card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the 
envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a 
newspaper clipping. 

The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding 
newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in 
the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry 
picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read: 

MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE 

SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE 

Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts 
Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual 
Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. 

A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, “We 
will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in 
Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse 
breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank. ” 

The Weasley family will be spending a month in 
Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year 
at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children 
currently attend. 



Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin 
spread across his face as he saw all nine of the 
Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of 
a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, 
balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all 
(though the black-and-white picture didn’t show it) 
with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the 
picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, 
Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his 
little sister, Ginny. 

Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a 
large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were 
very nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron’s 
letter and unfolded it. 

Dear Harry, 

Happy birthday! 

Look, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope 
the Muggles didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, 
and he reckons I shouldn’t have shouted. 

It’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all 
the tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses those 
old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn’t let 
Ginny come in the last one. There were all these 
mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who’d broken in 
and grown extra heads and stuff. 

I couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet 
Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it’s gone on 
this trip, but they’re going to buy me a new wand for 
next year. 

Harry remembered only too well the occasion when 
Ron’s old wand had snapped. It had happened when 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts 
had crashed into a tree on the school grounds. 

We’ll be back about a week before term starts and 
we’ll be going up to London to get my wand and our 
new books. Any chance of meeting you there? 

Don’t let the Muggles get you down! 

Try and come to London, 

Ron 

PS. Percy’s Head Boy. He got the letter last week. 

Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who 
was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was 
looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head 
Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his 
neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the 
Egyptian sun. 

Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. 
Inside was what looked like a miniature glass 
spinning top. There was another note from Ron 
beneath it. 

Harry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s 
someone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light 
up and spin. Bill says it’s rubbish sold for wizard 
tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at 
dinner last night. But he didn’t realize Fred and George 
had put beetles in his soup. 

Bye — 

Ron 



Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside 
table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, 
reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked 
at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the 
parcel Hedwig had brought. 

Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, 
and a letter, this time from Hermione. 

Dear Harry, 

Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to 
your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you’re all right. 

I’m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn’t 
know how I was going to send this to you — what if 
they’d opened it at customs? — but then Hedwig 
turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got 
something for your birthday for a change. I bought your 
present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in 
the Daily Prophet (I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so 
good to keep up with what’s going on in the wizarding 
world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a 
week ago? I bet he’s learning loads. I’m really jealous 
— the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating. 

There’s some interesting local history of witchcraft 
here, too. I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic 
essay to include some of the things I’ve found out. I 
hope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment more 
than Professor Binns asked for. 

Ron says he’s going to be in London in the last week of 
the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and 
uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I’ll see 
you on the Hogwarts Express on September first! 

Love from 



Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




Hermione 



PS. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really 
pleased. 

Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it. 

Harry laughed as he put Hermione ’s letter aside and 
picked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing 
Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of 
very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a 
huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a 
sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped 
across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit. 

“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the 
case to look inside. 

There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish 
Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig 
Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom 
for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself 
Broomcare. 

Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed 
most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most 
popular sport in the magical world — highly 
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. 
Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; 
he had been the youngest person in a century to be 
picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of 
Harry’s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two 
Thousand racing broom. 

Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his 
last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the 
brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the 
Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of 
paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, 
Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel 
gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it 
snapped loudly — as though it had jaws. 

Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send 
him anything dangerous on purpose, but then, 

Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what 
was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend 
giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from 
men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his 
cabin. 

Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly 
again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside 
table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over 
his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of 
the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled. 

And out fell — a book. Harry just had time to register 
its handsome green cover, emblazoned with the 
golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it 
flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the 
bed like some weird crab. 

“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered. 

The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and 
shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it 
stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space 
under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still 
fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees 
and reached toward it. 

“Ouch!” 

The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped 
past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry 
scrambled around, threw himself forward, and 



Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, 
sleepy grunt in the room next door. 

Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry 
clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms, 
hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, 
which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book 
shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, 
so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for 
Hagrid’s card. 

Dear Harry, 

Happy birthday! 

Think you might find this useful for next year. 

Won’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you. 

Hope the Muggles are treating you right. 

All the best, 

Hagrid 

It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a 
biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid’s 
card up next to Ron’s and Hermione’s, grinning more 
broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from 
Hogwarts left. 

Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry 
slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of 
parchment within, and read: 

Dear Mr. Potter, 

Please note that the new school year will begin on 
September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave 

Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




from King’s Cross station, platform nine and three- 
quarters, at eleven o’clock. 

Third years are permitted to visit the village of 
Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the 
enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to 
sign. 

A list of books for next year is enclosed. 

Yours sincerely, 

Professor M. McGonagall 
Deputy Headmistress 

Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and 
looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful 
to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an 
entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot 
there. But how on earth was he going to persuade 
Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form? 

He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two 
o’clock in the morning. 

Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form 
when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and 
reached up to cross off another day on the chart he’d 
made for himself, counting down the days left until 
his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses 
and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday 
cards. 

Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment 
Harry Potter felt just like everyone else — glad, for the 
first time in his life, that it was his birthday. 



Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 





AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 

Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to 
find the three Dursleys already sitting around the 
kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new 
television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present 
for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about 
the long walk between the fridge and the television in 
the living room. Dudley had spent most of the 
summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on 
the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate 
continually. 

Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a 
large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of 
mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday, 
none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had 
noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too 
used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of 
toast and then looked up at the reporter on the 
television, who was halfway through a report on an 
escaped convict: 



Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 



""... The public is warned that Black is armed and 
extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set 
up, and any sighting of Black should be reported 
immediately.” 

“No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle 
Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the 
prisoner. “Look at the state of him, the filthy 
layabout! Look at his hair!” 

He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy 
hair had always been a source of great annoyance to 
Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the 
television, however, whose gaunt face was 
surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry 
felt very well groomed indeed. 

The reporter had reappeared. 

“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will 
announce today — ” 

“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at 
the reporter. “You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s 
escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be 
coming up the street right now!” 

Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, 
whipped around and peered intently out of the 
kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would 
simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. 
She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent 
most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding 
neighbors. 

“When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding 
the table with his large purple fist, “that hanging’s the 
only way to deal with these people?” 



Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still 
squinting into next door’s runner beans. 

Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his 
watch, and added, “I’d better be off in a minute, 
Petunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten.” 

Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the 
Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth 
with an unpleasant bump. 

“Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh — she’s not 
coming here, is she?” 

Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister. Even though 
she was not a blood relative of Harry’s (whose mother 
had been Aunt Petunia’s sister), he had been forced to 
call her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the 
country, in a house with a large garden, where she 
bred bulldogs. She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive, 
because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, 
but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in 
Harry’s mind. 

At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had 
whacked Harry around the shins with her walking 
stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical 
statues. A few years later, she had turned up at 
Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and 
a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the 
year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had 
accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. 
Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up 
a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off 
until past midnight. The memory of this incident still 
brought tears of laughter to Dudley’s eyes. 

“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled, 
“and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fat 

Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




finger threateningly at Harry — “we need to get a few 
things straight before I go and collect her.” 

Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the 
television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle 
Vernon was Dudley’s favorite form of entertainment. 

“Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil 
tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.” 

“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s 
talking to me.” 

“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he 
had not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know 
anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — 
any funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself, 
got me?” 

“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth. 

“And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes 
now slits in his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge 
you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably 
Criminal Boys.” 

“What?” Harry yelled. 

“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be 
trouble,” spat Uncle Vernon. 

Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at 
Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge 
coming for a week-long visit — it was the worst 
birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, 
including that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. 



Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to 
his feet, “111 be off to the station, then. Want to come 
along for the ride, Dudders?” 

“No,” said Dudley, whose attention had returned to 
the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished 
threatening Harry. 

“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,” 
said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley’s thick blond 
hair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow tie.” 

Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. 

“See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the 
kitchen. 

Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified 
trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he 
got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to 
the front door. 

Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat. 

“I’m not taking you,” he snarled as he turned to see 
Harry watching him. 

“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to 
ask you something.” 

Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously. 

“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to 
visit the village sometimes,” said Harry. 

“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from 
a hook next to the door. 



Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry 
in a rush. 

“And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon. 

“Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it’ll 
be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that 
St. Whatsits — ” 

“St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased 
to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s 
voice. 

“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle 
Vernon’s large, purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll 
have to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I 
accidentally let something slip?” 

“ You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?” 
roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist 
raised. But Harry stood his ground. 

“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt 
Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly. 

Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an 
ugly puce. 

“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on 
quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to 
go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal 
and everything.” 

Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it 
over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was 
throbbing in his temple. 



Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




“Right,” he snapped finally. “I shall monitor your 
behavior carefully during Marge’s visit. If, at the end 
of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll 
sign your ruddy form.” 

He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and 
slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of 
glass at the top fell out. 

Harry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back 
upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a 
real Muggle, he’d better start now. Slowly and sadly 
he gathered up all his presents and his birthday 
cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with 
his homework. Then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol 
seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both 
asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then 
poked them both awake. 

“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to 
clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll look after 
you. I’ll write him a note, explaining. And don’t look at 
me like that” — Hedwig’s large amber eyes were 
reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll 
be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and 
Hermione.” 

Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note 
to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window 
and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly 
miserable, put the empty cage away inside the 
wardrobe. 

But Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no 
time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for 
Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their 
guest. 



Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - J.K. Rowling 




“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia 
snapped as he reached the hall. 

Harry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair 
lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the 
untidier he looked, the happier she would be. 

All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as 
Uncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the driveway, 
then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the 
garden path. 

“Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry. 

A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled 
the door open. 

On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like 
Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she 
even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In"

POTTER 




I 




DUDLEY DEMENTED 

The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to 
a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square 
houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually 
gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that 
were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; 
the use of hosepipes had been banned due to 
drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and 
lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive 
had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, 
windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a 
nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was 
a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a 
flower bed outside number four. 

He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who 
had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone 
who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His 
jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and 
faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away 
from the uppers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not 
endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of 
people who thought scruffiness ought to be 
Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 



punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself 
behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was 
quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only way he 
would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt 
Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room 
window and looked straight down into the flower bed 
below. 

On the whole, Harry thought he was to be 
congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, 
perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard 
earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at 
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not 
hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as 
had happened every time he had tried sitting down in 
the living room and watching television with his aunt 
and uncle. 

Almost as though this thought had fluttered through 
the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, 
suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the boy’s stopped trying 
to butt in. Where is he anyway?” 

“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not 
in the house.” 

Uncle Vernon grunted. 

“Watching the news ...” he said scathingly. “I’d like to 
know what he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares 
what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s 
going on, doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! 
Anyway, it’s not as if there ’d be anything about his lot 
on our news — ” 

“Vernon, shh\” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s 
open!” 

“Oh — yes — sorry, dear ...” 

Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle 
about Fruit ’N Bran breakfast cereal while he watched 
Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby 
Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning 
and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that 
he was concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had 
recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever 
she met him in the street. She had rounded the 
corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s 
voice floated out of the window again. 

“Dudders out for tea?” 

“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got 
so many little friends, he’s so popular ...” 

Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys 
really were astonishingly stupid about their son, 
Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies 
about having tea with a different member of his gang 
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew 
perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea 
anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening 
vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, 
and throwing stones at passing cars and children. 
Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks 
around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the 
holidays wandering the streets, scavenging 
newspapers from bins along the way. 

The opening notes of the music that heralded the 
seven o’clock news reached Harry’s ears and his 
stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight — after a 
month of waiting — would be the night — 

“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill 
airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike 
reaches its second week — ” 



Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle 
Vernon over the end of the newsreader’s sentence, 
but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry’s 
stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had 
happened, it would surely have been the first item on 
the news; death and destruction were more important 
than stranded holidaymakers... 

He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the 
brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been 
the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary 
relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and 
always, growing more insistent all the time, the 
question of why nothing had happened yet... 

He kept listening, just in case there was some small 
clue, not recognized for what it really was by the 
Muggles — an unexplained disappearance, 
perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the 
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the 
drought in the Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next 
door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, “with his sprinklers on 
at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter that had 
almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous 
actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if 
we’re interested in their sordid affairs,” sniffed Aunt 
Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in 
every magazine she could lay her bony hands on). 

Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening 
sky as the newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the 
budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this 
summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in 
Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins 
went to find out more...” 

Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached 
water-skiing budgerigars, there was nothing else 
worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and 

Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing 
to crawl out from under the window. 

He had moved about two inches when several things 
happened in very quick succession. 

A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a 
gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car 
and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and 
the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ 
living room, and as though Harry had been waiting 
for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time 
pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden 
wand as if he were unsheathing a sword. But before 
he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his 
head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and 
the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even 
louder. 

Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes 
streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street 
and spot the source of the noise, but he had barely 
staggered upright again when two large purple hands 
reached through the open window and closed tightly 
around his throat. 

“Put — it — away\” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s 
ear. “Now\ Before — anyone — sees!” 

“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds 
they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage- 
like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a 
firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as the pain in the 
top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, 
Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he 
had received an electric shock — some invisible force 
seemed to have surged through his nephew, making 
him impossible to hold. 



Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, 
straightened up, and stared around. There was no 
sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but 
there were several faces peering through various 
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back 
into his jeans and tried to look innocent. 

“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at 
Mrs. Number Seven, who was glaring from behind her 
net curtains. “Did you hear that car backfire just 
now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!” 

He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all 
the curious neighbors had disappeared from their 
various windows, then the grin became a grimace of 
rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him. 

Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop 
just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon’s 
outstretched hands could resume their strangling. 

“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle 
Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury. 

“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept 
looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see 
the person who had made the cracking noise. 

“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside 
our — ” 

“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly. 

Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside 
Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid. 

“Why were you lurking under our window?” 



Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing 
under our window, boy?” 

“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned 
voice. 

His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. 

“Listening to the news! Again?” 

“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry. 

“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know 
what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any 
more of this listening to the news tosh! You know 
perfectly well that your lot ...” 

“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle 
Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely 
hear him, ""... that your lot don’t get on our news!” 

“That’s all you know,” said Harry. 

The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then 
Aunt Petunia said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are 
all those — ” she too lowered her voice so that Harry 
had to lip-read the next word, “ — owls — doing if 
they’re not bringing you news?” 

“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. 
“Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get 
all your news from those pestilential birds!” 

Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something 
to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and 
uncle could not possibly know how bad Harry felt at 
admitting it. 



Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“The owls ... aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry 
tonelessly. 

“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once. 

“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 

“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt 
Petunia. 

“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon. 

“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper 
rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, 
he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, 
stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off 
up the street. 

He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have 
to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for 
his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at 
the moment; he had much more pressing matters on 
his mind. 

Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been 
made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It 
was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made 
when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that 
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be 
following him right at this very moment? As this 
thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back 
down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely 
deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did 
not know how to become invisible... 

He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was 
taking, for he had pounded these streets so often 
lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts 
automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over 

Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as 
he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was 
sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to him, why hadn’t 
they made contact, why were they hiding now? 

And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his 
certainty leaked away. 

Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. 
Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of 
contact from the world to which he belonged that he 
was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. 
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of 
something breaking inside a neighbor’s house? 

Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach 
and, before he knew it, the feeling of hopelessness 
that had plagued him all summer rolled over him 
once again... 

Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm 
at five o’clock so that he could pay the owl that 
delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point 
in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the 
front page before throwing it aside these days; when 
the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that 
Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and 
that was the only kind Harry cared about. 

If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying 
letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, 
though any expectation he had had that their letters 
would bring him news had long since been dashed. 

“We can’t say much about you-know-what, 
obviously...” “We’ve been told not to say anything 
important in case our letters go astray...” “We’re quite 
busy but I can’t give you details here...” “There’s a fair 



Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see 
you...” 

But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed 
too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had 
scribbled, “I expect we’ll be seeing you quite soon” 
inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As 
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their 
letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, 
presumably at Ron’s parents’ house. He could hardly 
bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the 
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he 
was so angry at them that he had thrown both their 
birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away 
unopened, though he had regretted this after eating 
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for 
dinner that night. 

And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why 
wasn’t he, Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself 
capable of handling much more than they? Had they 
all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it been he who 
had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being 
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly 
killed ... ? 

Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for 
the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough 
that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his 
nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking 
moments too. 

He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway 
along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of 
a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his 
godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how 
Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as 
empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at 



Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




least they contained words of caution and consolation 
instead of tantalizing hints: 

“ I know this must be frustrating for you...” “Keep your 
nose clean and everything will be okay...” “Be careful 
and don’t do anything rash...” 

Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia 
Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed 
toward the darkening play park, he had (by and large) 
done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the 
temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set 
off for the Burrow by himself. In fact Harry thought 
his behavior had been very good considering how 
frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet 
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in 
the hope of hearing something that might point to 
what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was 
quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who 
had served twelve years in the wizard prison, 

Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder 
he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone 
on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . 

Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off 
across the parched grass. The park was as empty as 
the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings 
he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends 
had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around 
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He 
would not be able to hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed 
again. Tomorrow he would have to think of some 
fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, 
he had nothing to look forward to but another 
restless, disturbed night, because even when he 
escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling 
dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in 
dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had 
something to do with the trapped feeling he had when 
Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead 
prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself 
that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very 
interesting anymore... In the past his scar hurting 
had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger 
again, but now that Voldemort was back they would 
probably remind him that its regular irritation was 
only to be expected... Nothing to worry about ... old 
news ... 

The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he 
wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, 
nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! 
And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for 
four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical 
world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so 
that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! 
How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? 
Why had Ron and Hermione got together without 
inviting him along too? How much longer was he 
supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and 
be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the 
stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort 
had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around 
in Harry’s head, and his insides writhed with anger as 
a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of 
the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that 
of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the 
park railings. 

He did not know how long he had sat on the swing 
before the sound of voices interrupted his musings 
and he looked up. The street-lamps from the 
surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong 
enough to silhouette a group of people making their 
way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, 
crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking 
noise came from several expensive racing bikes that 
they were wheeling along. 

Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front 
was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, 
wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful 
gang. 

Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting 
and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a 
change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly 
told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently 
become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing 
Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as 
Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more 
formidable than he had seemed to Harry in the 
primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s 
first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of 
his cousin anymore but he still didn’t think that 
Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately 
was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all 
around were terrified of him — even more terrified 
than they were of “that Potter boy,” who, they had 
been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended 
St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal 
Boys. 

Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass 
and wondered whom they had been beating up 
tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as 
he watched them. Come on ... look round ... I’m sitting 
here all alone... Come and have ago... 

If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would 
be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would 
Dudley do then? He wouldn’t want to lose face in 
front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of provoking 
Harry. . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s 
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him 
powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried 
hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he had his wand . . . 
let them try ... He’d love to vent some of his 
Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




frustration on the boys who had once made his life 
hell — 



But they did not turn around, they did not see him, 
they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the 
impulse to call after them... Seeking a fight was not a 
smart move... He must not use magic... He would be 
risking expulsion again... 

Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, 
heading along Magnolia Road. 

There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing 
rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what 
you’d have done ... 

He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and 
Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley 
turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime 
after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had 
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home 
after Dudley again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, 
Harry set off toward the park gate. 

Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, 
square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all 
owned by large, square owners who drove very clean 
cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred Little 
Whinging by night, when the curtained windows 
made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness 
and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving 
mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he 
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that 
halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into 
view again; they were saying their farewells at the 
entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into 
the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited. 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




""... squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was 
saying, to guffaws from the others. 

“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers. 

“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley. 

“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said 
Gordon. 

“See you then,” said Dudley. 

“Bye Dud!” 

“See ya, Big D!” 

Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on 
before setting off again. When their voices had faded 
once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia 
Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came 
within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling 
along at his ease, humming tunelessly. 

“Hey, Big D!” 

Dudley turned. 

“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.” 

“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry. 

“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again. 

“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into 
step beside his cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle 
Diddykins to me.” 

“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands 
had curled into fists. 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls 
you?” 

“Shut your face.” 

“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about 
‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them 
then?” 

Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself 
from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his 
self-control. 

“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry 
asked, his grin fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know 
you did Mark Evans two nights ago — ” 

“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley. 

“Oh yeah?” 

“He cheeked me.” 

“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been 
taught to walk on its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not 
cheek, Dud, that’s true ...” 

A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry 
enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was 
making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning 
off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet 
he had. 

They turned right down the narrow alleyway where 
Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a 
shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria 
Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets 
it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their 



Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one 
side and a high fence on the other. 

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t 
you?” Dudley said after a few seconds. 

“What thing?” 

“That — that thing you’re hiding.” 

Harry grinned again. 

“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose 
if you were, you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at 
the same time...” 

Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look 
sideways at it. 

“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know 
you’re not. You’d get expelled from that freak school 
you go to.” 

“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big 
D?” 

“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound 
completely convinced. Harry laughed softly. 

“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that 
thing, have you?” Dudley snarled. 

“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before 
you can beat up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing 
title you keep banging on about? How old was your 
opponent? Seven? Eight?” 

“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled 
Dudley, “and he was out cold for twenty minutes after 

Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




I’d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as 
you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing 
out — ” 

“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing 
champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?” 

“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley. 

“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when 
it goes all dark like this.” 

“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled. 

He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at 
his cousin. From the little he could see of Dudley’s 
large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant 
look. 

“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, 
completely nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be 
frightened of pillows or something?” 

“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. 
“Talking in your sleep. Moaning.” 

“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was 
a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had 
revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams. 

Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a 
high-pitched, whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! 
Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s Cedric — your boyfriend?” 

“I — you’re lying — ” said Harry automatically. But his 
mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — 
how else would he know about Cedric? 



Page | 19 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“ T)ad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo- 
hoo!”’ 

“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m 
warning you!” 

“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! 
He’s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to — ’ 
Don’t you point that thing at me\” 

Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing 
the wand directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel 
fourteen years’ hatred of Dudley pounding in his 
veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now, to jinx 
Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an 
insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers — 

“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. 
“D’you understand me?” 

“Point that thing somewhere else!” 

“I said, do you understand me?” 

“Point it somewhere else\” 

“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?” 

“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM — ” 

Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he 
had been doused in icy water. 

Something had happened to the night. The star- 
strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and 
lightless — the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps 
at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant 
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. 

The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly 
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -J.K. Rowling 




cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, 
silent darkness, as though some giant hand had 
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, 
blinding them. 

For a split second Harry thought he had done magic 
without meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been 
resisting as hard as he could — then his reason 
caught up with his senses — he didn’t have the power 
to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and 
that, trying to see something, but the darkness 
pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil. 

Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear. 

“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!” 

“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!” 

“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I — ” 

“I said shut up!” 

Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left 
and right. The cold was so intense that he was 
shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his 
arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were 
standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest 
extent, staring blankly around, unseeing . . . 

It was impossible... They couldn’t be here... Not in 
Little Whinging ... He strained his ears... He would 
hear them before he saw them... 

“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? 
What are you d-do — ?” 

“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis — ” 



Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had 
been dreading. 



There was something in the alleyway apart from 
themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, 
rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as 
he stood trembling in the freezing air. 

“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! Ill h-hit you, I swear I 
will!” 

“Dudley, shut — ” 

WHAM 

A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, 
lifting Harry off his feet. Small white lights popped in 
front of Harry’s eyes; for the second time in an hour 
he felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; 
next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and 
his wand had flown out of his hand. 

“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering 
with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees, 
now feeling around frantically in the blackness. He 
heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, 
stumbling. 

“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT 
AT IT!” 

There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s 
footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a 
creeping chill behind him that could mean only one 
thing. There was more than one. 

“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER 
YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry

muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground 
like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on — Lumosl” 

He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to 
help him in his search — and to his disbelieving 
relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the 
wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, 
scrambled to his feet, and turned around. 

His stomach turned over. 

A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly 
toward him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face 
visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it 
came. 

Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand. 

“Expecto Patronurrd” 

A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand 
and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked 
properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated 
farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic 
fogging his brain — concentrate — 

A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside 
the dementor’s robes, reaching for him. A rushing 
noise filled Harry’s ears. 

“Expecto PatronumV’ 

His voice sounded dim and distant... Another wisp of 
silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the 
wand — he couldn’t do it anymore, he couldn’t work 
the spell "
Harry Potter - THE OTHER MINISTER,"
* J 



/ 




THE OTHER MINISTER 

It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was 
sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that 
was slipping through his brain without leaving the 
slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for 
a call from the President of a far distant country, and 
between wondering when the wretched man would 
telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant 
memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and 
difficult week, there was not much space in his head 
for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on 
the print on the page before him, the more clearly the 
Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of 
his political opponents. This particular opponent had 
appeared on the news that very day, not only to 
enumerate all the terrible things that had happened 
in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) 
but also to explain why each and every one of them 
was the government’s fault. 

The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very 
thought of these accusations, for they were neither 
fair nor true. How on earth was his government 

Page | 2 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 



supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It 
was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were 
not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was 
fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at 
a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, 
sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the 
river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was 
lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very 
nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the 
government should have somehow foreseen the freak 
hurricane in the West Country that had caused so 
much damage to both people and property? And was 
it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert 
Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly 
that he was now going to be spending a lot more time 
with his family? 

“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent 
had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin. 

And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime 
Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more 
miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; 
all this chilly mist in the middle of July. ... It wasn’t 
right, it wasn’t normal. ... 

He turned over the second page of the memo, saw 
how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad 
job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked 
around his office mournfully. It was a handsome 
room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash 
windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable 
chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up 
and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin 
mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was 
then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he 
heard a soft cough behind him. 



Page | 3 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking 
reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He 
had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the 
empty room. 

“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt. 

For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible 
hope that nobody would answer him. However, a 
voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that 
sounded as though it were reading a prepared 
statement. It was coming — as the Prime Minister 
had known at the first cough — from the froglike little 
man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a 
small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room. 

“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. 
Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.” 

The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the 
Prime Minister. 

“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. ... It’s not a very 
good time for me. ... I’m waiting for a telephone call, 
you see . . . from the President of — ” 

“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. 
The Prime Minister’s heart sank. He had been afraid 
of that. 

“But I really was rather hoping to speak — ” 

“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. 

He will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the 
little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. 

Fudge.” 

“I ... oh ... very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. 
“Yes, I’ll see Fudge.” 

Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as 
he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and 
arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed 
and unfazed expression, when bright green flames 
burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble 
mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker 
of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within 
the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, 
he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, 
brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped 
cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand. 

“Ah ... Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding 
forward with his hand outstretched. “Good to see you 
again.” 

The Prime Minister could not honestly return this 
compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not 
remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional 
appearances, apart from being downright alarming in 
themselves, generally meant that he was about to 
hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was 
looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, 
and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The 
Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in 
politicians before, and it never boded well. 

“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand 
very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the 
chairs in front of the desk. 

“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, 
pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his 
green bowler upon his knees. “What a week, what a 
week ...” 

“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime 
Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had 



Page | 5 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




quite enough on his plate already without any extra 
helpings from Fudge. 



“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily 
and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been 
having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The 
Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... 
not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...” 

“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your 
people were — were involved in those — those things, 
were they?” 

Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern 
look. “Of course they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve 
realized what’s going on?” 

“I ...” hesitated the Prime Minister. 

It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him 
dislike Fudge’s visits so much. He was, after all, the 
Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to 
feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had 
been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge 
on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He 
remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew 
it would haunt him until his dying day. 

He had been standing alone in this very office, 
savoring the triumph that was his after so many 
years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard 
a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to 
find that ugly little portrait talking to him, 
announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to 
arrive and introduce himself. 

Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and 
the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. 
He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking 

Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince -J.K. Rowling 




to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt 
when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the 
fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained 
speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation 
that there were witches and wizards still living in 
secret all over the world and his reassurances that he 
was not to bother his head about them as the 
Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole 
Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical 
population from getting wind of them. It was, said 
Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything 
from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to 
keeping the dragon population under control (the 
Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for 
support at this point). Fudge had then patted the 
shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a 
fatherly sort of way. 

“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never 
see me again. I’ll only bother you if there’s something 
really serious going on our end, something that’s 
likely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical 
population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let 
live. And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than 
your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the 
window, thought I was a hoax planned by the 
opposition.” 

At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. 
“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?” 

It had been his last, desperate hope. 

“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.” 

And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a 
gerbil. 



Page | 7 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching 
his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, 
“but why — why has nobody told me — ?” 

“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to 
the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, 
poking his wand back inside his jacket. “We find it 
the best way to maintain secrecy.” 

“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a 
former Prime Minister warned me — ?” 

At this, Fudge had actually laughed. 

“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell 
anybody?” 

Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into 
the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and 
vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime 
Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and 
realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare 
mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the 
wide world would believe him? 

The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a 
time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had 
indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of 
sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain 
attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this 
uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to 
his delighted niece and instructed his private 
secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little 
man who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the 
Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had 
proved impossible to remove. When several 
carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried 
unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime 
Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply 
resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless 
and silent for the rest of his term in office. 
Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the 
corner of his eye the occupant of the painting 
yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or 
twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving 
nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. 
However, he had trained himself not to look at the 
picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly 
that his eyes were playing tricks on him when 
anything like this happened. 

Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the 
Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the 
portrait had once again announced the imminent 
arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, 
sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. 
Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was 
dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started 
ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never 
heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something 
that sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry 
Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the 
Prime Minister. 

""... Fve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, 
tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his 
bowler hat into his pocket. “Middle of the North Sea, 
you know, nasty flight . . . the dementors are in 
uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had a 
breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime 
Minister. Black’s a known Muggle killer and may be 
planning to rejoin You-Know-Who. ... But of course, 
you don’t even know who You-Know-Who is!” He had 
gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, 
then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill you 
in. ... Have a whiskey ...” 



Page | 9 



Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit 
down in his own office, let alone offered his own 
whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out 
his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber 
liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the 
Prime Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair. 

Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one 
point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and 
wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he 
had thrust into the Prime Minister’s whiskey-free 
hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the 
Prime Minister had stood up too. 

“So you think that ...” He had squinted down at the 
name in his left hand. “Lord Vol — ” 

“ He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\” snarled Fudge. 

“I’m sorry. ... You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named is still alive, then?” 

“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had 
fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but 
we’ve never found him. If you ask me, he’s not 
dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s Black we 
ought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that 
warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don’t see 
each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.” 

But they had seen each other again. Less than a year 
later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of 
thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime 
Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the 
Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) 
World Cup and that several Muggles had been 
“involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not to 
worry, the fact that You-Know- Who’s Mark had been 
seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an 
Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was 
dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke. 

“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re 
importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the 
Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the 
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical 
Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that 
we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly 
dangerous creatures into the country.” 

“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister. 

“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good 
day to you.” 

The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that 
dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but 
no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out 
of the fire yet again, this time with the news that 
there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban. 

“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister 
hoarsely. 

“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, 
already with one foot in the flames. “We’ll have them 
rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to 
know!” 

And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait 
just one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of 
green sparks. 

Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the 
Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not 
escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances 
at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a 
lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more 
Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to 
think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always 
called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the 
Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next 
time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news 
still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the 
fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and 
sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not 
know exactly why he was there, was about the worst 
thing that had happened in the course of this 
extremely gloomy week. 

“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — 
Wizarding community?” snapped the Prime Minister 
now. “I have a country to run and quite enough 
concerns at the moment without — ” 

“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. 

“The Brockdale Bridge didn’t wear out. That wasn’t 
really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work 
of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s family would be 
safer without him. We are currently making 
arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo’s 
Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move 
should be effected tonight.” 

“What do you ... I’m afraid I ... What?” blustered the 
Prime Minister. 

Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime 
Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he’s 
back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.” 

“Back? When you say ‘back’ ... he’s alive? I mean — ” 

The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the 
details of that horrible conversation of three years 
previously, when Fudge had told him about the 
wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard 

Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before 
his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier. 

“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is 
a man alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t really 
understand it, and Dumbledore won’t explain 
properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a body and 
is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for 
the purposes of our discussion, yes, he’s alive.” 

The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, 
but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well- 
informed on any subject that came up made him cast 
around for any details he could remember of their 
previous conversations. 

“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named?” 

“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his 
bowler rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you 
mean? Merlin’s beard, no. Black’s dead. Turns out we 
were — er — mistaken about Black. He was innocent 
after all. And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named either. I mean,” he added defensively, 
spinning the bowler hat still faster, “all the evidence 
pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but 
anyway, as I say, he’s dead. Murdered, as a matter of 
fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There’s going to 
be an inquiry, actually. ...” 

To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting 
stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, 
eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at 
the thought that, deficient though he himself might 
be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there 
had never been a murder in any of the government 
departments under his charge. ... Not yet, anyway ... 



Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the 
wood of his desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by- 
the-by now. The point is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, 
and steps must be taken.” 

“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. 
“Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?” 

“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by 
those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in 
January,” said Fudge, speaking more and more 
rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a 
lime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the 
open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale 
Bridge — he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a 
mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and 



“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed 
and I’m having to answer questions about rusted 
rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don’t 
know what else!” said the Prime Minister furiously. 

“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying 
you would have caved in to blackmail like that?” 

“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up 
and striding about the room, “but I would have put all 
my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he 
committed any such atrocity!” 

“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every 
effort?” demanded Fudge heatedly. “Every Auror in 
the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and 
round up his followers, but we happen to be talking 
about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a 
wizard who has eluded capture for almost three 
decades!” 



Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the 
hurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime 
Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It 
was infuriating to discover the reason for all these 
terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, 
almost worse than it being the government’s fault 
after all. 

“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably. 

“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now 
positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, 
roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries — ” 

“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named’s followers. And ... and we suspect 
giant involvement.” 

The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though 
he had hit an invisible wall. “ What involvement?” 

Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he 
wanted to go for the grand effect,” he said. “The Office 
of Misinformation has been working around the clock, 
we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify 
the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really 
happened, we’ve got most of the Department for the 
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running 
around Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s 
been a disaster.” 

“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously. 

“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the 
Ministry,” said Fudge. “What with all that, and then 
losing Amelia Bones.” 

“Losing who?” 



Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical 
Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
Named may have murdered her in person, because 
she was a very gifted witch and — and all the 
evidence was that she put up a real fight.” 

Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it 
seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat. 

“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the 
Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. 
“Our newspapers. Amelia Bones ... it just said she 
was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a — 
a nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of 
publicity. The police are baffled, you see.” 

Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. 
“Killed in a room that was locked from the inside, 
wasn’t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who 
did it, not that that gets us any further toward 
catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, 
maybe you didn’t hear about that one — ” 

“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened 
just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. 
The papers had a field day with it, ‘breakdown of law 
and order in the Prime Minister’s backyard — ’ ” 

“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely 
listening to the Prime Minister, “we’ve got dementors 
swarming all over the place, attacking people left, 
right, and center. ...” 

Once upon a happier time this sentence would have 
been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was 
wiser now. 

“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in 
Azkaban,” he said cautiously. 

Page | 16 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. 
They’ve deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must- 
Not-Be-Named. I won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.” 

“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of 
dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the 
creatures that drain hope and happiness out of 
people?” 

“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s 
causing all this mist.” 

The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the 
nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping 
through the towns and countryside, spreading 
despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel 
quite faint. 

“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! 
It’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!” 

“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m 
still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked 
three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has 
been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve 
never known them so united in my whole term of 
office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile. 

The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. 
Despite his indignation at the position into which he 
had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken- 
looking man sitting opposite him. 

“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I 
can do?” 

“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is 
nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to 
date on recent events and to introduce you to my 

Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now, but 
of course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so 
much going on.” 

Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little 
man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was 
digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching 
Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a 
moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.” 

“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the 
first time. “I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a 
day for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge. If he’d 
just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still 
be ... Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more 
success.” 

Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved 
silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the 
portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official 
voice. 

“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a 
meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus 
Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.” 

“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, 
and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate 
turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a 
second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him 
moments later onto the antique rug. 

Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, 
the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new 
arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, 
and look around. 

The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that 
Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion.

There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair 
and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes 
behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain 
rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a 
slight limp. There was an immediate impression of 
shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister 
thought he understood why the Wizarding community 
preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these 
dangerous times. 

“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, 
holding out his hand. 

Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the 
room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes. 

“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over 
to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. 
The Prime Minister heard the lock click. 

“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t 
mind, I’d rather that door remained unlocked.” 

“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour 
shortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his wand at 
the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. 
“Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to 
business. First of all, we need to discuss your 
security.” 

The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest 
height and replied, “I am perfectly happy with the 
security I’ve already got, thank you very — ” 

“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor 
lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets 
put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in 
your outer office — ”

‘Tm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s 
what you’re suggesting!” said the Prime Minister 
hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets through twice the 
work the rest of them — ” 

“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, 
without a flicker of a smile. “A highly trained Auror, 
who has been assigned to you for your protection.” 

“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. 
“You can’t just put your people into my office, I decide 
who works for me — ” 

“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said 
Scrimgeour coldly. 

“I am — that’s to say, I was — ” 

“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour. 

“I ... well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to 
be ... er ... excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, 
but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him. 

“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” 
he continued. “The one who has been entertaining the 
public by impersonating a duck.” 

“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister. 

“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed 
Imperius Curse,” said Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his 
brains, but he could still be dangerous.” 

“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. 
“Surely a bit of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink

“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for 
Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as 
we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of 
them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it best that we 
remove him from Muggle society for a while.” 

“I ... well ... He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the 
Prime Minister anxiously. 

Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back 
toward the fireplace. 

“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you 
posted of developments, Prime Minister — or, at least, 
I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in 
which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented 
to stay on in an advisory capacity.” 

Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he 
merely looked as though he had a toothache. 
Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for 
the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The 
Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them 
for a moment, then the words he had fought to 
suppress all evening burst from him at last. 

“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards'. You can do 
magic ! Surely you can sort out — well — anything !” 

Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged 
an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did 
manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The 
trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime 
Minister.” 

And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the 
other into the bright green fire and vanished.

SPINNER’S END 

Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed 
against the Prime Minister’s windows drifted over a 
dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish- 
strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a 
disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There 
was no sound apart from the whisper of the black 
water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that 
had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some 
old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass. 

But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure 
appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The 
fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new 
phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings 
for a few moments, then set off with light, quick 
strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass. 

With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure 
materialized. 

“Wait!”
